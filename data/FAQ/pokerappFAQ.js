        answer:'The short answer is that poker apps for real money provide you with access to stake cash on games with a view of making a profit, while free poker apps are designed to play for free without profit. However, many of our recommended real money poker apps also allow you to play free games.

This is a much more favorable experience if you are not yet ready to play for hard cash.',
