        question:'How Do Gambling Site Bonuses Work?',
        answer:'There are many different kinds of bonuses, and each one works a little differently. The most common bonus is a deposit bonus, where the site matches your deposit amount at a certain percentage. For example, if you claim a 200% bonus and deposit $100, the site will give you $200 in bonus funds to add to your bankroll. The most important thing you need to know about bonuses is that you need to read and understand the terms and conditions. Most bonuses have wagering requirements, maximum withdrawal amounts, and other restrictions. Make sure you understand all of those conditions before you accept any gambling site bonuses.',
