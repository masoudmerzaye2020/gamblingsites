        question:'What is a Flexi bonus?',
        answer:'Betway has a unique flexible bonus program that allows players to withdraw their cash balance at any time without having to clear bonus rollover requirements. This program divides your cash and bonus funds for each wager. If you decide to withdraw before you have cleared the wagering requirements, you will only be able to withdraw the cash funds. The bonus funds and winnings from bonus wagers will be forfeited.' ,

        question: "I've seen loads of negative Betway reviews. Should I trust them?",
        answer:  "It's tough to put much stock into many customer reviews of Betway since they're often written by disgruntled customers who screwed up in some way (whether they knew it or not). We recommend reading Betway reviews from customers, but just be prepared to take them with a grain of salt. You might ignore the lone review that says something like (Betway never pays), and instead pay attention to reviews or patterns saying the same thing from multiple customers.    Ultimately, though, we'd never recommend Betway.com if they were a scam site.",

If you are not interested in playing at Betway for real money, then here are two suggestions for where to look next. Our list of top-rated gambling sites is the fastest way to find a Betway alternative.
