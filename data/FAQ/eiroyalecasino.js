        question:'How are El Royale Casino’s reviews on Trustpilot?',
        answer:'El Royale has an average rating of 2.6 stars on Trustpilot, but we don’t think that rating is very accurate. It’s based on only four reviews. Three of those El Royale Casino reviews just state that the casino is a scam, but they don’t explain why the customer had an issue with the casino. The only review that actually details the customer experience is clearly from a customer who won some money initially and then had a losing streak. These reviews are not comprehensive enough to rate El Royale. Instead, they are most likely random complaints from a few customers who didn’t win or understand the terms and conditions. Our review of El Royale Casino is much more comprehensive and based on years of online casino experience. So if you decide to trust the reviews on Trustpilot, take them with a grain of salt.',
