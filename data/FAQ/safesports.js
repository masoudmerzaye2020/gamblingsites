        question: 'Why do betting sites ask for my ID and other documents?',
        answer:'It can be unnerving when online betting sites request documents like pictures of your ID, recent utility bills, or even pictures of your credit card. You don’t want that information falling into the wrong hands.   All of the most trusted online sportsbooks use those documents to verify your age and identity. The site’s licensing organization typically requires these protocols, but they also require the site to secure your data' ,

        question: 'How do I bet on sports online safely?',
        answer:'Finding secure betting websites is a good start, but it doesn’t guarantee the safety of your money and personal information. You have the responsibility to protect yourself following several simple rules that are mostly down to common sense.      Don’t pick easy passwords and don’t share your credentials with other people. Also, make sure to keep your email private and don’t open links or download files from emails that are from unknown senders.  It’s good to know legitimate betting websites won’t ask for your password, so don’t give it to people who pretend to be their representatives.    Simply put, don’t make stupid mistakes and you should be fine.' ,
