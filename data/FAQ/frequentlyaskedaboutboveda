        question:'Are Bovada’s bonuses worth it?',
        answer:'This question depends on your gambling preferences. The welcome bonuses on Bovada are an excellent way to get a little extra money to use for gambling, as long as you can meet the rollover requirement. Our review of Bovada revealed that their rollover requirements are lower than those on many other USA gambling sites. They give you six months to meet them too, which is awesome. You’ll have to decide for yourself if these bonuses are worthwhile. If you don’t think you will meet the rollover requirement, you can always deposit a smaller amount so that they are more manageable',
