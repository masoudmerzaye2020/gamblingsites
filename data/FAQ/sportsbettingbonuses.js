        question:'What’s the Best Way to Use Online Betting Bonuses?',
        answer:'Many people use free bets as an excuse to make a long-shot wager. It’s not coming out of their pocket and they can potentially win big, so why not, right? That’s an okay approach, but here’s what we think you should do instead. Follow basic betting strategies and find the markets with the most value. Then compare odds to get the best price. Do this and you’ll increase the chance of you adding some winnings to any bonus money you get.',

They will also send you emails with their best betting promotions. So, make sure you use an email address that you actually check when you create your account.

        question:'Do I HAVE to Claim a Betting Deposit Bonus?',
        answer:'No. Many betting sites have a checkbox on their deposit page that asks if you want a bonus applied to your account.      If they don’t, send them an email before you make a deposit. Otherwise they might apply a bonus to your account automatically and you won’t be able to make a withdrawal until you finish it.   You might choose not to claim a bonus or betting offer if you don’t want to have to meet the wagering requirements.',

        question:'Which Sports Betting Sites Offer the Best Bonuses?',
        answer:'It’s important to note that it’s not a good idea to join an online betting site just because they offer attractive bonuses and deals. You also want to make sure they offer action on the sports and events you want to bet on, that they have the banking options you want to use, and that they’re a safe and reputable betting site.',
