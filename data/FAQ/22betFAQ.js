        question: 'Do I Need a Bonus Code to Redeem a 22Bet Bonus?',
        answer:'No! Unlike other sites, 22Bet doesn’t use bonus codes. Instead, you will automatically receive your welcome bonus as soon as you make your first deposit. Most other bonuses have an opt-in link that you can find on the bonuses page. When you create your account, you will have the option to click a box that says, “I don’t want any bonuses.” If you click that box, you will not be eligible for any 22Bet bonuses. So, we recommend not clicking that box.' ,
