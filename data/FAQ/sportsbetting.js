        question:'Why is sports betting so popular?',
        answer:'Where do we start? There are MANY reasons why sports betting is such a popular form of gambling. For starters, the basics are very straightforward, so it’s really easy to just jump right in. Unlike some other forms of gambling, there’s no need to learn loads of complicated rules first. People also like the options they have to choose from when it comes to sports betting. Not only are there a wide variety of different sports available, but there are all kinds of different wagering options too. Some people like the challenge it presents. It’s a great way to put our sports knowledge to the test, and see if we really know as much as we think. Others simply enjoy the thrill that comes from betting on sports. Watching sports is SO much more exciting when there’s money at stake. One of the main reasons why sports betting is so popular is because it comes with the possibility of winning money. All we have to do is make a selection, get our money down, and we have the chance of earning a nice payout.',

        question:'Is it really possible to win money?',
        answer:'Yes, yes and yes again. We can’t stress this enough. We hate the fact that so many people think it’s impossible to win money from betting on sports. It really isn’t. Yes, it’s HARD to win regularly and consistently. And, yes, losing is always a possibility. But there are plenty of people out there who beat the bookmakers time and time again. Can YOU do the same? Absolutely. If you really want to, there’s very little that can stop you. You just need the right approach, the right skills and the right knowledge. All of that and more can be found right here in this guide.',

        question:'Why do most sports bettors lose?',
        answer:'You may have heard the well-known saying, “You never see a poor bookmaker.” This isn’t actually true, but the meaning behind the saying is entirely valid. Most bookmakers do make healthy profits, because they’re very good at maximizing the advantages they have over their customers. Plus, most of their customers aren’t prepared to do what’s necessary to beat them. These customers are usually more concerned with having fun than winning money, which is completely fine. The simple fact is that beating the bookmakers is very, very hard. It takes a lot of time and effort to become a successful sports bettor. The people who don’t put in that time and effort ARE going to lose.',

        question:'Is sports betting legal?',
        answer:'It depends. It isn’t in our nature to be so vague, but unfortunately we can’t answer this question definitively. Why? Well, it’s because the laws relating to sports betting vary from one part of the world to the next. In some regions it’s 100% legal, and in others it’s 100% illegal. In most regions, it’s not quite that clear cut. It’s quite common for some forms of betting to be legal and some to be illegal. The best advice we can offer here is simply to check your local laws.',

        question:'How much money do I need?',
        answer:'Relatively speaking, you can spend as much or as little money as you want. It’s unnecessary to spend large sums of money to enjoy yourself, and most bookmakers offer very low minimum stakes. A reasonable sized bankroll is required if you’re serious about trying to make money, but we’re not talking thousands here. The most important thing to remember is that you should only ever bet with money you can afford to lose. It doesn’t matter what the actual figure is, as long it’s not money that’s needed to pay the bills. Risking disposable income is fine, but risking the rent money is NOT.',

        question:'Can I get addicted to sports betting?',
        answer:'Yes. As with any form of gambling, or with any activity for that matter, there IS a risk of addiction. If you have an addictive personality, or struggle with self-control and discipline, then it’s probably best to forget about gambling completely. Addiction only affects the minority of gamblers, but it’s still important to be aware of the risk. Don’t ever make the mistake of thinking it can’t happen to you. It can happen to ANYONE. So please take the necessary precautions to make sure you know how to gamble responsibly.',

        question:'Where should I place my wagers?',
        answer:'Ultimately, this is your decision to make. Keep in mind that you may not have many options, though, depending on where you live. If you live in Nevada, or close by, then there’s the option of using the sportsbooks that are found in many of the Las Vegas Casinos. If you live in the United Kingdom, there are plenty of bookmaking shops to use. In other parts of the world, there’s a good chance that these option just won’t be available. However, as long as you have internet access then you can always use online betting sites. In fact, that’s exactly what we recommend doing. In our opinion, it’s EASILY the best way to place wagers. Just make sure that you only use reputable and trustworthy sites, like the ones we recommended further up this page.',

        question:'Which sports should I bet on?',
        answer:'Again, this is entirely up to you. There’s an argument that some sports are better than others for betting on, but the best sport for one person isn’t necessarily the best for someone else. It’s essentially a matter of personal preference. The most logical thing to do is concentrate on the sport(s) you know the most about. This will give you the best chance of winning money in the short term.',

        question:'How many sports should I bet on?',
        answer:'Again, this is your choice. It depends to some extent on whether you’re betting primarily for fun or primarily to make a profit. If it’s the former, it doesn’t really matter how many sports you bet on. If it’s the latter, we suggest maintaining a more narrow focus. You don’t necessarily have to specialize in one single sport, but it wouldn’t be wise to bet on a ton of different sports either.',
