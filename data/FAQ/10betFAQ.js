        question: 'How do I join the 10bet loyalty program?',
        answer:'The Ten Club is 10bet’s rewarding program for selected customers that is only open to 1,000 customers. There is no exact formula that will earn you an invitation, but it is based on loyalty from customers who bet regularly. So, the more often you bet, the more likely you will be to earn an invitation.' ,

        answer:'Yes! The esports betting options are listed as one of the categories in the main sportsbook. You can bet on Counter-strike, King of Glory, Dota2, League of Legends, and more! We found several leagues and tournaments for each game were covered during our 10bet sportsbook review.' ,

        question: 'Does 10bet allow winning bettors?',
        answer:'10bet does not prohibit winning bettors from using their site, but they do have several policies that discourage winning bettors.

        question: 'Can I use cryptocurrency to fund my 10bet account?',
        answer:'Unfortunately, 10bet does not accept deposits or withdrawals with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. That could change in the future, but we don’t think that is very likely. 10bet is very particular about identity verification. They will not process payouts without proof that you are who you say you are and you are the owner of the account. Cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous, so there is no way to verify that you own the account. Unless 10bet changes its identity verification policies, cryptocurrency will never be a viable banking option on this site.' ,

There is a betting app link on the bottom of the page, and you can use that link to find download links for both iPhone and Android.' ,
