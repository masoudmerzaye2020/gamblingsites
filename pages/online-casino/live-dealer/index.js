          <p>There are plenty of great reasons to gamble online, such as the convenience and lack of crowds. But some people like certain aspects of casino games that you don’t get with the virtual equivalents. That’s why live dealer games have proved so popular.</p>
          <p>Playing live games gives you a more authentic casino experience because you get to see the dealer handling the cards. The best online live dealer casinos offer live roulette, blackjack, baccarat and other games.

</p>
          <p>Finding the best live dealer online casino should be a personal process. You have to decide what games, banking methods, and bonuses will work best for you. But we can offer a starting point. Keep reading this page to learn all about live dealer games and how to find the best live dealer casinos online in 2022.

</p>
          <p>Online casinos do an excellent job of offering a digital casino experience, but they can’t compete with land-based casinos’ social climate and atmosphere. The best live dealer casinos do a good job of making the whole experience more realistic, though, while also offering the benefits of gambling online.</p>
          <p>We believe all players should at least consider playing real money live dealer casino games online. You can get the land-based casino experience without ever having to leave your house. Table and card games are dealt by real people using real equipment, and streamed live to online casinos.

</p>
          <p>There are pros and cons to going this route. We talk about this below, as well as the games and variants you can play, promotions you can claim, and much more.

</p>
          <p>The first thing we’ll talk about is the best live dealer casino available right now.

          <p>Every real money live dealer casino is different. They have different games, features, and promotions. But how do you find the best live casino for you without spending your precious time and your hard-earned dollars?

</p>
          <p>Joining one of the top online casinos that we endorse is the simplest solution. Our recommendations have been thoroughly tested in several key areas and ranked accordingly.

</p>
          <p>You can be sure that each one of these live casinos is of the highest quality. They’re all safe and trustworthy places to play. They all offer attractive bonuses and promotions, good customer service, and plenty of other benefits.

</p>
          <p>Most importantly of all, they all have a great selection of games. If you’re looking to play live dealer casino games online for real money, you won’t find any better options than the sites we recommend. You just won’t.

</p>
          <Title title={'Live Dealer Games, Variants, and Features'}/>
          <p>The games are the most important aspect of live online casinos. Blackjack, baccarat, and roulette are the most common live games, but some studios also offer poker variants, game shows, live slots, and other table games.

</p>
          <p>But don’t expect to find dozens of table games and variants that you can find in a regular, animated casino. Live dealer studios have space constraints like land-based casinos do.

</p>
          <p>Still, there are plenty of live casino games to choose from, especially if you join an online casino that works with more than one major studio. Let’s look at some of the games you can play now, starting with the most popular.

</p>

          <div>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Blackjack'} desc={'This includes variants such as VIP, Early Payout, HD, Exclusive, and much more. You’ll often have a half dozen tables to choose from stakes starting at $5 and often exceeding $5,000.'} />
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Baccarat'} desc={'The most common options include baccarat and Super 6 Baccarat. Super 6 is a side bet on whether the banker will win with a six. Table stakes start at $5 and often exceed $2,500.'} />
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Roulette'} desc={'The most common roulette variations are American and European Roulette, though Auto and Lightning Roulette are also options. Table limits start at less than $1 and can sometimes exceed $10,000.'} />
          </div>
          <p>These are the most common games available on all of the best live casinos online. That said, you’ll find way more than three tables to choose from. There are often a dozen tables or more, not including the different dealers or stakes you can play for. For example, check out this blog with five unique blackjack games at live casinos.

</p>
          <p>The casinos that we recommend all offer these popular games. Some are better for specific games, though, which is why we’ve also ranked the top live dealer online casinos for each one</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Other Live Dealer Casino Games'}/>
          <p>There are many other live casino games you can find. But whether you can play them depends on the casinos you can join and the providers they work with. Here are some of the other live games you can find online.

          <TextTitle title={'Live dealer casinos are coming up with new games all the time. We suggest you join a couple of casinos that work with different providers so you get exposure to the widest variety of live casino table games.'}/>
          <p>Not only will you find different games from each provider, but different variations and feature sets, too. Here’s an overview of the variants and features you can expect to find on the best online live casinos.</p>

          <div>

            <Mainbullet link={''} title={'Features'} desc={'This includes options to chat with the dealer or other players, to switch or adjust the camera angles, to bet behind other players, adjust the sound or stream quality, and more.'}/>
          </div>

          <p>Like the games, the different variants and features that casinos offer come down to the providers they work with.

</p>

          <Title title={'How Do Live Casino Games Work?'}/>
          <Wideimage src={'/image/'}/>
          <p>Understanding how live games work will help you know what to expect when you start playing for the first time. The good news is that these games are reasonably straightforward.

</p>
          <p>Live dealer games are similar to table games in land-based casinos. The dealer will sit at a traditional casino table and deal the cards from a shoe or spin a roulette wheel. However, instead of players sitting across from them, there is a camera or multiple cameras.

</p>
          <p>The cameras film the dealer as they deal. Some studios have additional cameras to offer multiple perspectives or focus on the cards or the roulette wheel so that you can see the cards/wheel and the dealer simultaneously.

</p>
          <p>There is also a screen next to the camera so that the dealer can see the chatbox. They will get a notification when a new player joins, so they can welcome each user by their screen name. They can also see player chats. You can ask them questions in the chatbox, and they will respond verbally.

</p>
          <p>The videos are live-streamed to the casino site. So, you can see the video feed in real-time as you play. Some live games even have live news feeds in the background so you can verify the time. That’s really all there is to know about how live casino games work. If you unsure about which games to start with, check out this blog with the best live games for beginners.</p>

          <Title title={'Live Online Casino Studios and Providers'}/>
          <p></p>
          <div>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Evolution Gaming'} title={''} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Playtech'} title={''} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Pragmatic play'} title={''} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Authentic Gaming'} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Visionary iGaming (ViG)'} desc={''}/>
          </div>
          <p>Just like software providers for digital games, live studios must be licensed, and their games must be tested. Their license may affect which jurisdictions their games are available in. For example, ViG is the only provider listed above that works with US casinos.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'How Live Dealer Providers Impact Your Experience'}/>
          <p>It’s hard to explain how important casino software providers are. But once you experience the difference between multiple providers, you will understand. Here are some of the ways different live dealer providers will affect your experience.

</p>
          <div>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'The quality of the live stream'} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'The games and variants you can play'} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'The stakes you can play for'} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'The features available for each game'} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'The side bets you can make'} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'The languages the dealers speak'} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'The casino setting or backdrop'} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Any time constraints the games impose (to keep the game moving at a reasonable pace)'} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Whether you can play their games on mobile (and how)'} desc={''}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Whether you can play the games for free'} desc={''}/>

          </div>
          <p>Finding a software provider you prefer is only half the battle. You also need to consider the factors that each casino controls. Multiple casinos may use the same software providers, but they will have different promotions, banking options, terms and conditions, and security measures.

</p>
          <p>Since every live online casino is different, we don’t recommend you join the first casino you find that works with the studio or provider you like the most. You want to find the best provider and casino combination. That’s how you find the right live dealer casino for you.

</p>

          <Title title={'RNG Games vs. Live Dealer Casinos Online'}/>
          <Wideimage src={'/image/'}/>
          <p>Live casino games are a blast to play. They combine the convenience and cost efficiency of playing from home with the atmosphere and socializing you get from land-based casinos.

</p>
          <p>But it can be difficult to know what to expect if you have never played these games before. We’re going to compare live dealer games to digital casino games, so you have a better idea of what to expect. Here are the key differences between digital (RNG) casino games and games at the best live casinos online.

</p>
          <div>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Live Games Have Human Dealers and Croupiers'} desc={'The biggest difference between live and RNG casinos is the fact that live dealer games have actual people dealing the cards and managing the game. It gives the game a similar feel to playing in a land-based casino.'}/>
            <p></p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Live Dealer Games Have Higher Table Limits'} desc={'For high-stakes players, live online casinos are the way to go. You can play for hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars per hand. We’ve seen games that accept bets as high as $250,000.'}/>
            <p></p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Fewer Hands Per Hour at Live Dealer Games'} desc={'Digital table games handle between 4 and 40 hands per minute. Live games only run between 100-120 hands per hour. The lower speed makes it easier to manage your bankroll, even with higher wagers.'}/>
            <p></p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Live Casino Dealers Aren’t Always Available 24/7'} desc={'Most live online casinos have their dealers work in shifts, so there is almost always a dealer available. However, if you have a particular dealer you like, you will have to wait until their next shift to play with them again.'}/>
            <p></p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Live Casino Games Provide the Opportunity to Socialize If You Want'} desc={'If you miss the social aspect of gambling, you will enjoy chatting with other players and the dealers on live casino games. You can always turn the chat feature off if you would rather avoid people.'}/>
            <p></p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Fewer Variations of Live Dealer Games'} desc={'Unfortunately, live casinos don’t offer as many variants as digital table games. You can find a few options for each game, but you will need to mix in some digital games if you want more variety.'}/>

          </div>
          <p>Those are the key differences between live dealer and regular online casinos. If you want to play hundreds of hands per hour, play for the smallest limits, and play in total isolation, then animated games are the way to go.

</p>
          <p>On the other hand, if you want realism, the option to socialize, or the option to play for thousands of dollars per hand, live casino games are a better option. Of course, there’s no reason why you can’t play both.

</p>

          <Title title={'Live Online Casinos vs. Land-Based Casinos'}/>
          <Wideimage src={'/image/'}/>
          <p>If you are used to playing casino games in a brick-and-mortar casino, you might be skeptical of how live online games could provide a similar experience. There are undoubtedly some significant differences. So, let’s look at how live dealer online casinos compare to land-based casinos.

</p>
          <div>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Live Casinos Offer Unique Promotions'} desc={'When you use the best live dealer casino, you can take advantage of promotions, like deposit bonuses, free bets, and VIP programs. These are often far more valuable than land-based comps programs.'}/>
            <p></p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Play Live Games Anywhere'} desc={'You can play live online games anywhere you can access the internet. There is no need to drive to your local casino or travel. Land-based casinos cannot compete with the convenience that live online casinos offer.'}/>
            <p></p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Live Dealer Table Limits Are Smaller'} desc={'Live Dealer Table Limits Are Smaller'}/>
            <p></p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Live Dealer Casinos Have More Tables and Unlimited Seats'} desc={'Have you ever had to wait for a seat at a land-based casino? That doesn’t happen when you use the best online casino to play live dealer games. Many online games have unlimited seats or unlimited bet behind.'}/>
            <p></p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Live Dealer Casinos Offer Unique Variants'} desc={'Land-based casinos have limited space, so they only offer the most popular variants. Live dealer studios have more room to work with, so they have more freedom to offer unique variants.'}/>
            <p></p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Land-based casinos have limited space, so they only offer the most popular variants. Live dealer studios have more room to work with, so they have more freedom to offer unique variants.'} desc={'Even if you play for similar stakes, you’ll save money playing online games instead of land-based table games. That is because you don’t have to spend money on travel expenses, food, tips and other expenses.'}/>
            <p></p>
          </div>

          <p>Those are the biggest differences between playing live dealer games online and playing land-based casino games. If you want to take a vacation, see the sights, watch shows, enjoy free drinks, etc., and you have money to burn, then playing in a land-based venue is an option to consider.

</p>
          <p>However, if you want to only spend what you have to, you want the option to socialize, and you want more variants, features, and promotions, then online live dealer casinos are the better option.

</p>
          <p>Once again, though, there’s no reason why you can’t enjoy both options. That’s how we like to do things.

</p>

          <Title title={'The Best Live Dealer Online Casinos for Mobile Games'}/>
          <Wideimage src={'/image/'}/>
          <p>Online casinos are convenient because you don’t have to leave your house to access all their games. But mobile casinos are even more convenient because you can play their games anywhere you go.

</p>
          <p>All of the best live casinos online have a mobile-compatible website. That means you can access their site from a mobile browser the same way you would access it from a computer. You just type in the URL, and you’re good to go.</p>
          <p>Some casinos also have downloadable apps that you can use instead of a mobile site. There are not many differences between downloadable apps and browser sites, but some people prefer one or the other.

</p>
          <p>Either way, you should be able to access their live dealer games. Be aware that the video feed might lag if you have a poor internet connection. It might work better if you connect to wi-fi. Check out the live dealer apps page to learn more about finding the best mobile live dealer options.

          {/* leave provile card */}
          <Title title={'Live Casino Promotions'}/>
          <Wideimage src={'/image/'}/>
          <p>We mentioned earlier that one of the benefits to gambling online are the promotions you can claim. They’re far better than the promotions land-based casinos offer. Here are some of the standard promotions available when using one of the best online live casinos.

</p>
          <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Free Bets for Live Casino'} desc={' Free bets are like insurance for your wagers. If you win, you get nothing, but the casino will reimburse you if you lose. These promotions are typically worth $10-$30, and they are only available on specific bets.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Deposit Bonus'} desc={'The casino will match your first deposit at a certain percentage. These bonuses are an excellent way to increase your bankroll, but live dealer games are sometimes excluded. Make sure you read the terms and conditions before you claim this bonus.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'VIP Program '} desc={' Loyalty programs give you points for your wagers and allow you to earn cashback or other rewards for your points. Make sure you check the terms and conditions to learn how many dollars you have to wager to earn points.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} title={'Additional Casino Offers '} desc={' Many live online casinos have temporary promotions. They may offer contests, tournaments, and other special offers. These offers change regularly, so check the promotions page to learn more.'}/>
          </div>
          <p>All of these promotions can add value to your experience, but it is crucial to understand that casinos aren’t giving this money away for free. Even the best online casino with live dealer games will have terms and conditions on their promotions.

</p>
          <p>The terms and conditions will determine what games qualify, how much you can win, and even when you can withdraw. Read the terms and conditions carefully and make sure you understand them before you claim a bonus.

</p>
          <p>We have a whole page dedicated to bonuses and rewards that will help you understand how these terms and conditions will affect you. If you still have questions, you can always reach out to customer service for help.

          <Title title={'Finding the Best Live Online Casinos'}/>
          <Wideimage src={'/image/'}/>
          <p>There is a significant difference between average sites and the best live dealer online casino. The best sites have more games, better promotions, and more convenient banking options. They are also more secure and safer to use.</p>
          <p>Finding the best live casino sites is a long process. It requires research, testing, and extensive knowledge of the industry. You could try to do it all on your own or let us do it for you.

</p>
          <p>We have already researched, tested, reviewed, and ranked hundreds of live casinos. And we update our recommendations regularly to consider new sites and updates.

</p>
          <p>If you don’t want to trust our rankings at face value, you might want to check out our reviews. We have full-length reviews that cover everything you need to know, including live dealer game variety, banking methods, promotions, security measures, and even the company background./

</p>
          <p>Reading one of our reviews will help you understand everything that each site offers. Once you see how in-depth our reviews are, you will understand why our rankings are trustworthy.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'How to Avoid Scam Casinos'}/>
          <p>Unfortunately, some live casinos online exist to take advantage of their customers. They trap players with predatory terms, make excuses to avoid paying withdrawals, or close players’ accounts without explanation.

</p>
          <p>These rogue casinos are difficult to identify because they are very good at appearing legit. You can read customer reviews online, but it is hard to know how many of those are accurate.

</p>
          <p>We have come across several of these sites in our efforts to find the best online live dealer casinos. So, we decided to keep track of them by creating our own casino blacklist.

</p>
          <p>Just as our reviews can help you know which casinos are worth your time, our blacklist will help you know which ones to avoid. Taking a few minutes to check it out can help you learn the warning signs to watch for and more information about scam casino sites.
