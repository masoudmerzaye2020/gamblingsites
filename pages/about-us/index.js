            Since the early days of gambling over the internet, the industry has
            evolved at a fast pace, but it’s still relatively young and the
            online gambling landscape is constantly shifting.
          </p>
          <p className={style.paragraph}>
            Legislation around the world changes all the time, technology
            advances, new sites open, and some sites make improvements while
            others get left behind.
          </p>
          <p className={style.paragraph}>
            All of this makes it hard to stay up to date with what’s happening,
            and in particular, it’s difficult to know which sites to use and
            which ones to avoid. A leading site one year could easily be
            overtaken by several others and might no longer be one of the best
            options the following year.
