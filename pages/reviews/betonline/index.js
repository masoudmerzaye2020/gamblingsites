        <Title title={'BetOnline.ag Background'}/>
        <p>Before we explain all about the betting options and casino games you can play on BetOnline, we want to answer one of the most critical questions for US gamblers. Is BetOnline safe and trustworthy?</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p>The simple answer is that we believe BetOnline is safe and trustworthy in 2022, but we want to acknowledge that wasn’t always the case.</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>You deserve to know about the company that is operating BetOnline and the issues it had before. Then, we will explain why we think things are different now.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Licensing and Company Information'}/>
        <p>BetOnline is a licensed real money gambling site. The site has a license from the Panama Gaming Control Board. A license from Panama is not as strictly regulated as licenses from other licensing authorities, but it is still a valid and trustworthy licensing authority.</p>
        <p>The site is operated by a privately-held company that started in 1991. It started as an offline bookmaker and quickly moved to the online gambling industry. They were known then as BestLineSports.com.</p>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/BetOnline_ag.jpg'} desc={'The company name changed to BetOnline in 2007, but they allegedly started the company as early as 1991.'}/>
        <p>BestLineSports.com bought the BetOnline.com name in 2006 and started doing business as BetOnline in 2007. Then they changed to the current domain of Betonline.ag in 2012. That was a response to the DOJ seizing several .com gambling domains in 2011.</p>
        <p>In May 2012, BetOnline acquired SportsBetting.ag, which is one of the oldest online sportsbooks that still exists today. That acquisition was surprising because it came at a time when the future of BetOnline was itself a little insecure. Here is more information about what happened with BetOnline in 2011.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'BetOnline Scams and Payout Concerns'}/>
        <p>BetOnline launched an online poker network in 2011. When the poker network launched, an issue came out about BetOnline lying to its customers. After that, several other issues came to light.</p>
        <div className='pink'>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'They lied about their poker network. The BetOnline poker product was on the Action Network, but they claimed to be on the Hero Poker Network and Chico Poker Network. It was a strange lie because the network didn’t matter, but lying about it caused customers to lose trust.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Several customers complained about BetOnline confiscating their funds. BetOnline claimed that these customers were cheating, but they had no proof.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'BetOnline allowed multiple accounts from the same IP address to join a poker table. One customer got caught chip dumping, but they didn’t address it until that customer had won significant amounts of money.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Customers who contacted customer service were informed that the customer service representatives knew customer account information, including their passwords.'}/>

        </div>

        <p>All of these issues are significant concerns; they were reason enough for many customers to close their accounts and choose other sports betting sites. And we don’t want to downplay these issues or pretend they didn’t exist. But, we do have reason to believe that things have changed since then.</p>
        <p>The acquisition of SportsBetting.ag happened right after many of these issues came to light. SportsBetting was having issues of its own with customers complaining about not getting paid.</p>
        <p>When BetOnline acquired SportsBetting, they agreed to settle all of the site’s past and future accounts. They ended up paying more than $1.5 million just to get SportsBetting’s overdue accounts up to date.

        </p>
        <p>BetOnline also added some new members to its management team during the acquisition. As a result, they were able to address the customer service complaints and help BetOnline rebuild its reputation.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Is BetOnline.ag Safe in 2022?'}/>
        <p>Now that you know all about the history of BetOnline and the valid concerns that customers had, the question remains. Is BetOnline a legitimate sportsbook in 2022, and can you trust them as a safe online casino?</p>
        <p>Ultimately, you have to make that decision for yourself. To help you make an informed decision, let us explain why we believe the site is trustworthy today starting with the bulk of their complaints. Most of these complaints occurred between 2011-2012.</p>

        <Borderedbox>
          <p>BetOnline has had almost a decade without any of these complaints coming up again. Search Google for reviews of BetOnline and you’ll see that they have had hundreds of satisfied customers since then.</p>
        </Borderedbox>

        <p>It is also worth noting that all of the complaints were because of the BetOnline poker network. None of the customers who used the sportsbook and casino ever had any issues.</p>
        <p>BetOnline has introduced new payment methods since the issues they had in 2011. It is one of the only US online gambling sites that consistently processes credit card deposits without issues. The site now has a reputation for processing payments within 1-3 days in most cases, depending on the banking method you choose.</p>
        <p>We won’t deny that BetOnline had a rocky start, but they have consistently addressed those concerns and rebuilt their reputation. If you’re still interested in checking them out, keep reading our review of BetOnline to learn more about their gambling options, bonuses, and more.</p>

        <Title title={'BetOnline’s Banking Options'}/>
        <p>The variety of banking methods that BetOnline offers is one reason why BetOnline is such a top-rated gambling site. You can use credit cards, e-wallets, money orders, wire transfers, or cryptocurrencies to deposit to your account. Many of those same banking methods are available for withdrawals as well.</p>
        <p>Here is an overview of the banking methods on BetOnline, along with the deposit and withdrawal limits, fees, and cashout times.</p>


      {/*   {/ leave the table /} */}
        <p>We like that BetOnline has so many banking options to choose from. In addition, they consistently add new cryptocurrency options because that is a popular choice – especially for American gamblers.</p>
        <p>The BetOnline payout reviews are positive too. Most customers report receiving their payouts quickly, which further supports the fact that BetOnline has turned a new leaf.</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p>However, it is disappointing that BetOnline charges so many fees. There are fees for most of the non-crypto banking options, and the fees often depend on your transaction amount.</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>If they are going to charge fees, they should charge a standard amount. With their current system, you often get punished for depositing or withdrawing larger amounts.</p>
        <p>Many online gambling sites charge fees on withdrawals, but they almost always offer free deposits. Unfortunately, we noticed during our BetOnline review that they charge fees on both deposits and withdrawals.</p>
        <p>As long as you plan on using cryptocurrency for all your transactions, you won’t have any fees to worry about. Cryptocurrency is also the fastest way to get your winnings.</p>

        <Title title={'Promotions on BetOnline'}/>
        <p>Another thing that stood out to us during our review of BetOnline is the promotions they offer. We specifically like that they have different promotions you can choose based on the type of gambling you prefer.</p>
        <p>Here is an overview of some of the promotions on BetOnline.</p>
        <TextTitle title={'Welcome Bonuses for New Customers '}/>
        <p>There are three different welcome bonuses on BetOnline. You can choose the bonus you want based on the type of gambling you want to enjoy.

        </p>

        <div className='blue'>         
            <div className='md:float-right justify-center flex'><Image src={'/image/reviews/BetOnline-welcome-bonuses-for-new-customers.png'} width={200} height={200} alt={''}/></div>
            <div>
              <Mainbullet link={''} title={'Sports Betting Welcome Bonus'} desc={' - Get a 50% deposit bonus of up to $1,000 with the bonus code BOL1000. These bonus funds can only be used on sports wagers, and there is a 10x rollover.'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} title={'Casino Welcome Bonus'} desc={'- If you prefer casino games, you can get a 100% deposit match on your first three deposits, for a total bonus of $3,000. The code for this offer is BOLCASINO, and there is a 30x rollover requirement. '}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} title={'Poker Welcome Bonus'} desc={' - The last bonus offer is for poker players. It offers a 100% deposit match of up to $1,000 with the code NEWBOL. These bonus funds are released in $5 increments every time you earn $50 in rake. There is no additional rollover requirement.'}/>            
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>It is important to understand that each of these online casino bonuses is only available to real money BetOnline customers, and only on your first deposit. You need to decide which bonus you want to take on that first deposit because you won’t be able to collect the other welcome bonuses. You only get to choose one, which is a bit of a bummer.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there are plenty of other promotions that BetOnline offers once you’re finished with your welcome bonus.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Sports Betting Promotions'}/>
        <p>Sports bettors have several bonus options to choose from. Some of them are available any time, while others are only available on certain types of bets.</p>

      {/*   {/ leave the tabel /} */}

        <p>These sports betting promotions are available any time, but the free plays are only available on your first time making that type of bet. These are a great way to test out a specific type of betting (like in-play betting) or betting on a specific sport.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to these promotions, BetOnline often has special promotions for in-season sports or special events. For example, they offer to double your winnings on UFC fights if a knockout lands on the BetOnline logo.</p>
        <p>There are loads of sports betting bonuses and promotions at BetOnline.ag. If you decide to join BetOnline.ag today, we recommend you bookmark their promotions page and keep an eye out on your email. That way, you never miss out on an offer.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Casino Promotions'}/>
        <p>We also found several promotions during our BetOnline casino review. They offer reload bonuses, tournaments, and random giveaways. These promotions are available only for casino games, so keep in mind that the terms and conditions will differ from the terms for their sports betting and poker promos.</p>
        <p>These are the best casino promotions we found during our BetOnline review.</p>

{/*         {/ leave the tabel /} */}

        <p>These are just a few of the casino promotions available. They also have daily tournaments and progressive jackpots available.</p>
        <p>In addition to these promotions, BetOnline also has promotions for poker players, horse race betting, esports betting, referrals, and additional contests. Many of these additional promotions change regularly, so you should check their promotions page often to find out the latest promos available.</p>
        <p>Or visit our BetOnline bonuses page to learn about their latest deals and bonus codes.</p>

        <Title title={'BetOnline Sportsbook Review'}/>
        <p>Now that we’ve covered the banking options and promotions, it’s time to look at the gambling options. We’ll start with our review of the BetOnline sportsbook, which is often THE reason why people join BetOnline. Why is that? Well, one reason is all the different sports and events you can bet on.</p>
        <p>You’ll find all the sports and events BetOnline accepts action on in their sidebar under one of two headings – Main Sports and Other Sports. These are the sports and events we found betting markets for during our BetOnline betting site review.

        </p>
{/*         {/ leave the table /} */}
        <p>This isn’t the biggest variety of sports and events, but it does cover a lot of ground. There are many US sporting events to bet on, as well as international events like rugby, handball, and snooker.</p>
        <p>One thing that stood out to us is that they accept bets on politics. This is where you’ll find betting markets for the US presidential elections, as well as elections held around the world.</p>
        <p>The entertainment betting markets stood out to us, too. Here are a couple examples of entertainment markets we found during our latest review.</p>

        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Which will be the first country to be attacked by aliens?'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Who will date Bill Gates next?'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Who will host the 2022 Golden Globes?'}/>
        </div>
        <p>This stood out to us because most entertainment betting sites accept action on TV shows, movies, and music. It’s not often you see odds for celebrity dating or alien wars. That makes them different from other top-rated online sportsbooks, which might be reason enough to create an account here.</p>

        <div className='green'>
          <TextTitle title={'What are the Betting Limits at BetOnline.ag?'}/>
          <div>
            <div className='md:float-right justify-center flex'><Image src={'/image/reviews/BetOnline-betting-limits.png'} width={200} height={200} alt={''}/></div>
            <p>Like most online betting sites, the betting limits at BetOnline varies. It depends on the sport or even what you’re betting on; whether you’re betting on a regular season game or an event. For example, you might be looking for where to place Super Bowl bets.</p>
            <p>That said, the minimum bet at BetOnline.ag is $1. The maximum bet is $1,500 to $3,000 for money lines, point spreads, and totals for sports like basketball, hockey, and college sports.</p>
            <p>For more popular sports or leagues, such as the NFL or college football, you the betting limits at BetOnline are as high as $15,000-$25,000.</p>
            <p>If that’s not high enough, just know that you might be able to increase your betting limits. All you need to do is contact customer support and they’ll tell you whether your account is eligible for an increase.</p>
          </div>
        </div>


        <Title title={'Esports Betting on BetOnline.ag'}/>
        <p>One option you will not see in the sidebar is esports. BetOnline added a link to their esports odds to their main navigation instead. For that reason, we expected their esports betting options to be robust.

        </p>
        <p>We did spot quite a few esports betting markets while using the online sportsbook at BetOnline.ag. They offer live esports betting too, as well as futures. They even have a tab for early markets, which had odds for esports tournaments as far as a week out.</p>
        <p>These are the esports games we found odds for during our last BetOnline sportsbook review.</p>

        <div>
          <div className='md:float-right justify-center flex'><Image src={'/image/reviews/BetOnline-esports-coverage.png'} width={200} height={200} alt={''}/></div>
        
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Counter-Strike'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'DOTA 2'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Valorant'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Rainbow Six'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'King of Glory'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'FIFA'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'League of Legends'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Rocket League'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Starcraft 2'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'World of Warcraft'}/>
          
        </div>
        <p>If you enjoy esports betting, then you’ll probably be happy to know that they have a promotion running that we didn’t mention above. When you bet on esports at BetOnline.ag, they’ll give you a 20% rebate on your losses every week.This is a great way to minimize your losses and boost your sports betting profits.

        </p>
        <p>Overall, between their esports section, Main and Other Sports, and their racebook, you will have lots of betting options. We recommend you have multiple betting accounts so that you can compare odds.</p>
        <p>That said, if you are only able to have ONE betting account, BetOnline.ag is a good account to have.</p>


        <Title title={'Review of the BetOnline Online Casino'}/>
        <p>Now that we’re done with our BetOnline online sportsbook review, it’s time to talk about their casino. The online casino is impressive due to the wide variety of games available. They have so many games because they work with several software providers.</p>
        <p>We found games from the following software providers during our BetOnline casino review.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Let’s explore some of the games you can play using the online casino at BetOnline.</p>

        <div className='blue'>
          <TextTitle title={'Slot Machines'}/>
          <p>There are more than 250 slot games available in the BetOnline Casino. So no matter what themes or bonus features you are looking for, they are sure to have a few games that will interest you.</p>
          <p>Betsoft slot games are known for having the best graphics, and the games from Flipluck Games have a lot of bonus excellent bonus features. Here are a few slots that we recommend checking out.</p>
          <div>
            <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/Best-BetOnline-slot-machines.png'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Jungle Stripes'} desc={'is a fun jungle-themed slot game with a high RTP, and both ways pay lines.'}/>

          </div>
          <p>These are just a few of the games we enjoyed during our review of the BetOnline casino. The more you explore the slots they have to offer, the more you will find games and software providers you like.</p>
          <p>We recommend playing these games for real money because they are a lot more exciting when you win. But you can also play demo versions if you want to try a game for free before you play with cash.</p>
        </div>

        <div className='pink'>
          <TextTitle title={'Table Games'}/>
          <p>The BetOnline casino also has a full range of table games available. Here are some of the options we noticed in our BetOnline online casino review.</p>
          <div>
            <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/Casino-table-games-at-BetOnline.png'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'There are 17 different blackjack variants, including multi-hand blackjack, single-deck blackjack, 21 burn, double exposure, and blackjack switch.'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'You can choose from nine different roulette options and two craps games.'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'BetOnline has a wide variety of table poker games, including Caribbean poker, bonus Texas hold ‘em, pai gow poker, and big rollover hold ‘em.'}/>

            <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'There are also three different baccarat options.'}/>
          </div>
          <p>You will notice that there are a lot of repeated variants of different games. For example, there are nine roulette games, but the only options are American or European roulette.</p>
          <p>Each software provider creates its own version of table games. For example, they may have different graphics or a different way of setting up the game screen. If you are comparing blackjack variants, the versions from each software provider may also have different rules.</p>
          <p>We recommend checking out a few different games from each software provider to decide which one you like best.</p>

          </div>
          <p>These options cover the most popular video poker variants, but some players might be disappointed because games like All American and Tens or Better are not included.

</p>
          <p>However, BetOnline also offers multi-hand variants of most of these games. You can play up to 25 hands of Jacks or Better and Jokers Wild. There are also five-hand options available. considering that many online casinos have gotten rid of multi-hand video poker games, BetOnline might be the best USA casino site for video poker enthusiasts.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Specialty Casino Games'}/>
          <p>If all of those casino games haven’t convinced you yet, BetOnline still has more to offer. They have a specialty games section with keno, bingo, scratch cards, and other casino games. Here are some of the specialty games we found during our BetOnline review.</p>
          <div>
            <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/BetOnline-specialty-games.png'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''}  desc={'There are five different keno options available. Three of them include a progressive jackpot, but we recommend checking out Keno Megapays for a chance to win up to $200,000.'}/>

          </div>
          <p>We would have wholeheartedly recommended the BetOnline casino if they didn’t have these specialty games. The site already has so much to offer, so they went above and beyond by including games that you can’t find anywhere else.</p>

        <Title title={'BetOnline Poker Review'}/>
        <p>BetOnline.ag is one of the best online poker rooms for Americans. They’re on the Chico Poker Network, which is approximately 13th in overall traffic and 3rd for US poker sites. When we wrote this BetOnline poker review, they had approximately 2,778 players on their site. Nearly 500 of those players were seated at cash games.</p>
        <p>Considering their traffic levels, we expected to see a lot of good things in the BetOnline poker room. Were we right? Let’s find out.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Software Upgrades'}/>
        <p>The first thing we want to cover in this BetOnline online poker review is their software. How is their software? It’s pretty good, and much better than it used to be. BetOnline performed a much-needed software upgrade in 2016 due to all the complaints they received about blurry graphics, and poor sound and animation.</p>

        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/The-BetOnline-poker-room-has-a-new-look.jpg'} desc={'The BetOnline poker room has a new look.'}/>
        <p>We noticed that their software upgrade included several customization options. Here are the options that stood out to us during our review.</p>
        <div className='md:grid md:grid-cols-2'>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Activate window on your turn'}/>

          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Adjust the animation'}/>
        </div>
        <p>The bet slider is arguably our favorite poker feature on BetOnline.ag. You can set it up so that you have multiple buttons with your favorite bet sizing for both pre- and post-flop action. This will save you A TON of time – time that you can now dedicate to making profitable poker decisions.</p>

        <div className='blue'>
          <TextTitle title={'Is There a Betonline Poker Download?'}/>
          <p>Yes, there is a download for the BetOnline.ag poker room. The download is compatible with both Windows and Mac.</p>
          <p>There is also a BetOnline browser app. We prefer this option so that you don’t need to bog down your PC with software. There is little difference between the download and browser poker room, as far as we could tell.</p>
          <p>The browser poker room is also how you play BetOnline poker from your mobile device. The mobile poker room is compatible with both Android and iOS phones and tablets.</p>
        </div>

        <div className='pink'>
          <TextTitle title={'Are You Allowed to Use a Hud?'}/>
          <p>BetOnline supports HUD software like Poker Tracker. HUD software collects hand histories from the games you play and then provides you with various data you can use during gameplay.</p>
          <p>This is great for experienced poker players since more information equals better and more profitable decisions.However, this comes at the expense of amateur poker players who might not know what a HUD is or how to get one, or don’t play enough to justify using one.</p>
          <p>Many online poker sites offer anonymous tables which helps to level out the playing field. Unfortunately, we did NOT SEE any anonymous tables during our BetOnline poker review.</p>
          <p>For that reason, we’d say that BetOnline is probably a better choice for serious poker players. Amateur poker players will still enjoy playing poker at BetOnline, but they might enjoy the poker games at Bovada even more.</p>
        </div>

        <TextTitle title={'Cash Games'}/>
        <p>BetOnline has a limited selection of poker games that includes Texas hold’em, Omaha, and Texas 6+.</p>
        <p>Their cash games range from 0.05/0.10 to 15/30 depending on the game and format you play. It’d be great to see 0.01/0.02 or 0.02/0.05 level, but that might be tough for BetOnline to sustain with their current traffic levels. Besides, if you can afford to play 2nl or 5nl, then 10nl is doable too.</p>
        <p>Here are all the games, limits, and formats we found during our review.</p>

{/*         {/ leave the table /} */}

        <TextTitle title={'Poker Tournaments at BetOnline'}/>
        <p>BetOnline runs many poker tournaments. When we last reviewed BetOnline, they had around 15 tournaments running and at least 2-3 dozen more planned for the rest of the day.

        </p>
        <p>We’re impressed with the variety of online poker tournaments they offer. We found buy-ins as low as 0.10, which is great if you’re on a budget and trying to build your poker bankroll.</p>
        <p>They offer a variety of tournament formats. Guaranteed poker tournaments dominate, as they do at nearly all online poker sites. You can also find satellite, knockout, rebuy, and freeroll tourneys too.</p>
        <p>One of the things that impressed us the most is how often their flagship tournaments run. Many of them run multiple times per day or week. You don’t have to worry about missing one, because another opportunity is likely just around the corner.</p>

{/*         {/ leave the table /} */}
        <p>BetOnline also runs a decent Sunday majors tournament schedule. There are 10 poker tournaments every Sunday with buy-ins ranging from $6-$530 and guarantees as high as $150k.</p>
{/*         {/  leave the table /} */}
        <p>A $6 or $11 buy-in for a tournament is awesome, especially considering you can win a chunk of a $15k or higher prize pool.</p>
        <p>However, don’t worry if any of these buy-ins are out of your price range. BetOnline runs many satellite tournaments, some of which are for their Sunday poker tournaments. This is a great way to get a seat to a more expensive tournament for a fraction of the price.</p>
        <p>We could keep this BetOnline poker review going, but we’re sure you get the point by now. They have an awesome tournament selection, as well as plenty of SNGs to keep you busy between events.</p>
        <p>Overall, their poker product is strong. There are a few downsides, such as their lack of anonymous tables or lack of niche games like stud or mixed poker. That said, we think most players will enjoy playing online poker at BetOnline.</p>

        <Title title={'Our Review of the BetOnline App'}/>
        <div>
          <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/BetOnline-mobile-app.png'}/>
          <p>BetOnline is available any time and anywhere, thanks to their mobile gambling options.</p>
          <p>There are a couple of different ways you can access BetOnline from a mobile device. Some of them depend on what kind of gambling you want to enjoy.</p>
          <p>For example, there is a BetOnline poker app you can download to your device if you want to join poker tournaments or play no limit hold’em cash games from your phone.</p>
          <p>If you want to bet on sports or play casino games, there isn’t a BetOnline app to download. Instead, your best option is to visit BetOnline.ag from your device’s mobile internet browser.

</p>
          <p>The mobile site allows you to access the full sportsbook and casino options, and you don’t have to wait for an app to download.</p>

          <Borderedbox>
            <p>No matter how you decide to visit BetOnline on a mobile device, you can enjoy all of the same bonuses, banking methods, and features that you do on the desktop site.</p>
          </Borderedbox>
        </div>
        <p>You can learn more about the BetOnline mobile app by reading the following review.</p>

        <Title title={'How is the Customer Support at BetOnline.ag?'}/>
        <p>We didn’t run into any issues during our review of BetOnline.ag, nor have we run into many issues in the past. But it’s inevitable that you will the more you use their site. And that goes for all gambling sites.</p>
        <p>When you do, you can reach out to BetOnline’s customer support. It’s easy to do. Just scroll down to the bottom of their site and you’ll see a few of your options.</p>

        <div className='blue'>

          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Email – cs@BetOnline.ag'}/>

        </div>

        <p>They also have a FAQ and help center. We recommend you start here since they answer all the basic questions people have about gambling at BetOnline for real money. You’ll also notice in these sections that they have a contact form, three other customer support emails, and a phone number.</p>

        <div className='blue  md:grid-cols-2'>

        </div>
        <p>It’s awesome to see that BetOnline.ag offers phone support. Not every US online gambling site does, so that’s a big positive in our books.</p>
        <p>But how is their support? Will you get the help you need? If you read other BetOnline reviews – especially from customers – you’ll see that it’s a mixed bag. Some people have a positive experience, others more negative.</p>
        <p>We’ve contacted the customer support at BetOnline in the past and didn’t have any issues. Your mileage will vary, of course, but we don’t anticipate you having any issues either.</p>

          <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/Positive-review-of-BetOnline_ag.png'}/>
          <p>What do we think? Is BetOnline legit?

</p>
          <p>Yes, BetOnline.ag is legit. It’s a great online gambling site. In fact, you can’t go wrong having a real money account here regardless of what you want to bet on or play. You can’t say that about many gambling sites.</p>
          <p>BetOnline.ag is truly a triple threat. They’re a good choice if you want to play casino games, bet on sports, or play online poker.</p>
          <p>What’s more is that they’re one of the best sites for US online gamblers. They accept a variety of banking methods – including cryptocurrencies – and now have a solid reputation in the industry despite their past.</p>
          <p>You can’t beat their variety of welcome bonuses and ongoing promotions, either.</p>
          <p>The bottom line – if you enjoy a mix of online gambling activities and only want to play at safe gambling sites, then you should strongly consider creating an account at BetOnline.ag.</p>
