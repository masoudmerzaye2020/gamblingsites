    <Header>Expert Review of El Royale Casino (Updated for 2022)</Header>
    <Section>
      <Container>
        <p>Our first El Royale Casino review was published almost two years ago. We gave them a favorable review then. Here are a few reasons why.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'The unique black and purple roaring 20’s theme.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Solid collection of online casino slots and digital and live casino table games.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Generous promotions for online slot players.'}/>
        </div>
        <p>Two years is a long time to go without an update, so we thought it was time to review El Royale again. We went in wanting to answer one question – is El Royale Casino legit in 2022?</p>
        <p>The short answer – yes. Feel free to click the button below to sign up and start playing at El Royale Casino for real money now.</p>
        <p>That said, El Royale can improve in some areas. We’re going to tell you all about that, plus everything else we love about them, in our review of El Royale Casino below.</p>

        {/* {/ leave the rest /} */}

        <Title title={'About the El Royale Online Casino'}/>
        <p>You’ll be disappointed if you visit the El Royale online casino “About Us” page looking for information. The page features an inviting story that beckons you into the casino’s speakeasy, but it doesn’t actually tell you anything about the casino or the company that operates it.</p>
        <p>We did some more research during our ElRoyaleCasino.com review to find out more. Here are some details that prove El Royale Casino is legit.</p>
        <div className='yellow'>
          <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/el-royale-casino.png'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Infinity Media Group LTD is the company that owns and operates El Royale. This company also operates several other top USA online casinos, including Las Atlantis, Red Dog Casino, Slots Empire, and Aussie Play.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'El Royale is a licensed online casino with a license from the Curacao e-Gaming Authority. Licenses from Curacao are not as strict as some other licensing organizations, but it’s one of only a few licensing organizations that allows companies to operate in the US.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'All the digital games on El Royale are brought to you by RealTime Gaming. RTG is one of the most prominent software providers for USA casinos. Visionary iGaming is the provider for live dealer games on El Royale.'}/>

        </div>

        <p>Because they use reputable casino software and are owned by a trustworthy company, we believe El Royale is safe for all real money gamblers. Therefore, you should be able to use the site without any concerns.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, if you believe your experience on El Royale is unfair, you can get help from a third-party mediator. You can make a formal complaint with the Central Disputes System. CDS is a third-party organization that audits online casinos and mediates complaints with their customers.

</p>
        <p>The association with CDS makes El Royale even more trustworthy, and it should give you peace of mind.</p>

          </div>

          <p>We recommend you read their terms and conditions before you join in case their list of prohibited countries has changed since we last updated this El Royale Casino review.</p>

        </div>

        <Title title={'El Royale Casino Review'}/>
        <p>El Royale Casino uses RealTime Gaming software for their digital games. This gives us a predictable but also reliable and fun library of casino games including table and card games, video poker, and slots.

</p>
        <p>They also offer live dealer casino games from Visionary iGaming (ViG). This gives you the opportunity to play table games like roulette and blackjack with a human dealer from the comfort of your own home.</p>
        <p>What we want to do now is show you some of the games we found and enjoyed testing during our review of El Royale Casino.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Table and Card Games'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/el-royale-casino-table-games.png'}/>
        <p>Our first El Royale casino review revealed more than 20 table and card games. However, this number has dropped off a bit since then. These are the games we found during our most recent visit.

</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'European Roulette'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack + Perfect Pairs'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Caribbean Draw Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Caribbean Hold’Em Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Caribbean Stud Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Let ‘Em Ride'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Suit ‘Em Up Blackjack'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Tri Card Poker'}/>
        </div>


        <p>Most of these games are under the Table Games heading, while you’ll find their roulette games in their Specialty section. This isn’t as organized as we’d like, but it’s a minor thing overall.</p>
        <p>What we’re most disappointed with is their lack of overall table and card games. Where are all the blackjack and roulette variations? Where is Casino War, Pai Gow Poker, or Andar Bahar?</p>
        <p>Most online casinos have them beat in this department. We hope they read this ElRoyaleCasino.com review and add more games soon. Otherwise, it’ll make more sense for you to play these games elsewhere.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Video Poker'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/video-poker-games-at-el-royale-casino.jpg'}/>
        <p>El Royale has 14 video poker machines for you to choose from – the same number of variations they had during our first visit.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Aces and Eights'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'All American Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bonus Deuces Wild'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Double Bonus Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Double Double Bonus Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Double Double Jackpot Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Loose Deuces Sevens Wild'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Deuces Wild'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bonus Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bonus Poker Deluxe'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Jacks or Better'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Joker Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Double Jackpot Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Sevens Wild'}/>
       
        </div>

        <p>These games remind us of the video poker machines we played in Las Vegas. The graphics aren’t fancy and the games are simple – just as they should be.</p>
        <p>The stakes you can play for depends on the machine. We found machines that let us wager anywhere from $0.01 to $1 per credit. This means the max you can wager is $5 per hand.</p>
        <p>If you want to wager more per hand, we recommend you play one of their multi-hand variants. They offer three-, ten-, and 52-hand variants for each of the poker games listed above. Play the 52-hand variant at $5 per hand and that comes out to $260 per round. Not too bad.</p>
        <TextTitle title={'El Royale Casino Slots'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/online-slots-at-el-royale-casino.png'}/>
        <p>We found more than 125 slots machines during our El Royale online casino review. Here are a few of the slot games we enjoyed playing the most.</p>

        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Bubble Bubble 2'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Cash Bandits 3'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Aztec’s Millions'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Spirit of the Inca'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Megasaur'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Texas Tycoons'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Voodoo Magic'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Secret Jungle'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Rudolph’s Revenge'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Asgard'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Count Spectacular'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Fire Dragon'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Football Fortunes'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Ghost Ship'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={''} desc={'Halloween Treasures'}/>
        </div>

        <p>El Royale categorizes their slots to make them easier to find. You can sort their machines by three-, five-, and six-reels, bonus rounds, progressives, and floating symbols.</p>
        <p>This is a good start, but we’d love it if they also had a slot theme category. That way, you could choose a slot machine based on themes like animals, money, fairytales, outer space, movies, and more.</p>
        <p>That’s our only complaint, though. All the games worked during our El Royale Casino review – we didn’t experience any lags or errors or anything else worth reporting. Their slots section gets two thumbs up from us.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Live Dealer Games'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/live-dealer-games-from-el-royale-casino.jpg'}/>
        <p>ElRoyaleCasino.com has a live dealer casino from Visionary iGaming. These are the games we found during our review.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack HD'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack Early Payout'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'European Roulette'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Auto European Roulette'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'American Roulette'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Auto American Roulette'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Live Baccarat'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Super6 Baccarat'}/>
        </div>
        <p>You won’t find live dealer games like Casino Hold’em, Dragon Tiger, Monopoly, or Dream Catcher here. But that’s hardly a complaint or mark against them since that’s the case for all US live dealer casinos.</p>
        <p>One thing that stood out to us during our El Royale Casino review are their live dealer table stakes. You can play these games for much higher limits than their digital table games. For example, you can play live dealer blackjack for as much as $2,500 per hand. And you can play live baccarat and roulette for as much as $1,000 per round.</p>
        <p>Our biggest complaint is that their video stream is a little grainy. It’s not nearly as clear or bright as the live dealer games from Evolution Gaming. That might be for the best, though, as that might mean that you can play these games with a slower internet connection.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, we suggest you check out the live casino. It’s a nice addition to the digital games RealTime Gaming provides the online casino at El Royale.

        <Title title={'Review of El Royale Casino on Mobile'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/El-Royale-review-mobile-app.png'}/>
        <p>El Royale has a mobile casino site that you can access from your device’s internet browser. It’s compatible with any internet-enabled device, including Androids, iPhones, iPads, and tablets.</p>
        <p>Some players may be disappointed because there is no downloadable El Royale app, but most players won’t notice a difference. The mobile site allows you to do everything that an app would.</p>
        <p>All the games that are available on the desktop version of El Royale Casino are also available on the mobile site, including the live dealer casino games. We tried several mobile games during our review of El Royale. The games functioned the same on our smartphones as they did on the desktop version.</p>
        <p>One thing that really stood out to us was how crisp the graphics looked when we played slots and other games on our smartphones. The graphics weren’t blurred or fuzzy at all. That is a good sign that the software is specifically designed to adapt to the device you are using.</p>
        <p>We also noticed a few minor differences that enforced that process. For example, many of the slots automatically launch in full-screen mode when you play on a mobile device, and the spin button will appear on the side of the screen instead of the bottom.

</p>
        <p>You’ll also notice that the slot games have a left-hand mode on the mobile casino. This setting allows you to change the position of the buttons so that it’s easier when you hold your phone with your right hand. The left-hand mode and other organizational differences make it easier and more convenient to use your mobile phone or other devices to play casino games on El Royale.</p>
        <p>We enjoyed testing out the El Royale Casino mobile site during our review, and we think you’ll like it too. However, if you want to learn more about it, then read our El Royale Casino app review.

          <Bluebutton link={''} title={'El Royle Casino App Review'}/>
        </div>
        <Title title={'Banking Options at El Royale Casino'}/>
        <p>The banking options on El Royale make it easy to get your money to and from your casino account quickly. They have multiple options to choose from, including credit cards, cryptocurrency, and e-wallets.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Deposit Methods'}/>
      {/*   {/ leave the table /} */}

        <p>Most deposits get processed instantly, but crypto deposits may take up to 15 minutes.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Withdrawals on El Royale Casino'}/>
      {/*   {/ leave the table /} */}

        <p>The withdrawal limits are the same for all withdrawals. You can withdraw between $150 and $2,500 at a time. However, you may be able to get increased withdrawal limits based on your VIP level.
</p>

        <div className='bg-[#fff5ff]'>
          <TextTitle title={'Where El Royale Casino Can Improve'}/>
          <p>There are many good things about the banking options at El Royale Casino. We like that they accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin, that you can deposit as much as you want with crypto. You can’t beat the 1-3 day waiting period for cash-outs, either.</p>
          <p>That being said,  we noticed a couple of details during our review of El Royale’s banking options that we would like to see changed.

</p>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'El Royale could offer more banking methods. Specifically, we would like to see additional crypto options since that’s the most convenient banking method for American gamblers.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'It’s disappointing that El Royale only has one crypto option for withdrawals when they accept three different cryptos for deposits. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able to cash-out in Litecoin or Ethereum, too.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'We’d like to see a lower withdrawal limit. If you have less than $150 in your account, you either have to deposit more or keep playing. We think they should drop the minimum to $25-$50.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'On the other end of the spectrum, the maximum withdrawal of $2,500 is disappointingly low. If you win a progressive jackpot, you’ll have to withdraw your winnings in several small increments. They should either increase these limits or make an exception for progressive jackpot winners.'}/>
          <p>Other than these minor complaints, we were pleased with the banking options during our El Royale review. And despite these complaints, it should still be easy to find a banking option that works for you.</p>

          <Title title={'Reviewing El Royale Casino’s Promotions'}/>
          <Wideimage title={'/image/reviews/El-Royale-review-bonuses.jpg'}/>
          <p>One of the most appealing aspects of El Royale is the wide variety of offers for both new and existing customers. Here’s an overview of the available bonuses at El Royale Casino.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'El Royale Casino Welcome Bonuses'}/>
          <p>There are five different online casino bonuses available under the Welcome Bonuses category. These promotions are one-time offers that you can only use during your first few deposits.  </p>
          <p>The primary welcome bonus is a 240% deposit match on your first deposit. Along with the deposit match, you can also get 40 free spins on Bubble Bubble 2.</p>
          <p>In addition to the first deposit bonus, you can also get a 260% deposit match on your second deposit. Or you can choose from one of the other welcome bonus offers that El Royale online casino has available.

</p>

        {/*   {/ leve the table /} */}

          <p>These offers are reasonably similar. The primary difference is whether you can use the same code on multiple deposits or only once.
</p>
          <p>If you choose to activate the 1st and 2nd deposit deals, you will not be eligible for any other welcome bonuses. So, if you prefer to spread your bonus out, you may want to consider one of the other options.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Special Offers'}/>
          <p>In addition to the welcome bonuses, El Royale has several bonuses that existing customers can take advantage of. Most of the reload bonuses follow the same structure as the welcome bonuses. However, some offer additional rewards based on the deposit method you choose or the amount you deposit.</p>

       {/*    {/ tabable /} */}

          <p>El Royale also has a new game bonus offer that changes regularly. It typically includes a deposit match and free spins on a particular game. Check the new game bonus page for the latest offers.</p>
          <p>It’s also a good idea to keep an eye on your account messages. This site often sends messages that include details of additional promotions that are only available for a limited time to your El Royale inbox.</p>
          <p>You can also find more El Royale bonuses on the following page.</p>

          <div className='flex flex-wrap justify-center'>
            <Bluebutton link={''} title={'El Royale Casino Bonuses'}/>
          </div>

          <TextTitle title={'Comp Points'}/>
          <p>You can also earn comp points for every $10 you wager on the El Royale online casino. Those comp points can be converted to cash at a rate of one dollar for every 100 points.</p>
          <p>We appreciate how straightforward the VIP program is. There are no tiers to keep track of or complicated contribution rates for various games. However, the simplicity of the VIP program also means that there are no exciting prizes or rewards to earn. The only reward you can get is bonus cash.

</p>
          <p>If you are looking for perks like free tournaments, prioritized withdrawals, or other perks, you might be disappointed with El Royale’s VIP program.</p>

          <Title title={'Our Experience with Customer Support'}/>
          <div>
            <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/El-Royale-review-customer-support.png'}/>
            <p>We didn’t run into any issues during our review. All the El Royale Casino reviews we’ve read reported positive experiences too. However, it’s inevitable that you’ll need help at some point. When you do, you can reach out to the customer support at ElRoyaleCasino.com using one of these options.</p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Email – assistance@elroyalecasino.com'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Phone – +1 850 400 3297 or +61 1300 924 017'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Live chat'}/>
          </div>
          <p>We sent them an email to ask about their promotions, specifically about the maximum bonus you can earn, their comp points, and the option to play their games for free.</p>
          <p>They responded quickly, which is awesome. But they could have done a better job with their answers. They answered our second question but ignored the other two.</p>
          <p>We eventually got our answers, but it would’ve been nice to have gotten ALL the help we needed from the customer support team. On the bright side, they did respond to us quickly. They have phone support too, which is a claim only a few US online casinos can make.</p>
          <Title title={'Wrapping Up Our El Royale Casino Review'}/>
          <div>
            <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/el-royale-casino-review.png'}/>
