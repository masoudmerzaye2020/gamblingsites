    <Header>Our Detailed Review of BetNow.eu for 2022</Header>
    <Section>
      <Container>
        <p>BetNow.eu is a online casino and sportsbook that’s available to players worldwide. This includes Americans, which is always good news.</p>
        <p>It’s been a few years since the site took it’s first online bet, so we thought it’d be a good idea to review BetNow.eu for our readers to see at whether they’re worth joining in 2022.</p>
        <p>We start every review with an open mind, and this one was no different. We were excited, even, after what we saw on their homepage. They were advertising several offers including a 50% casino bonus, 50% up to $500 sports bonus, and 8% rebate in their race book.</p>
        <p>That’s not all their promotions, either. We cover a few more in the promotions section of our review below.

</p>
        <p>Then we started the review. And, like always, we found a few things we liked. This included some of their games, banking limits, and promotions.</p>
        <p>However, we found several things we disliked, too. Things that might stand in the way of you signing up.</p>
        <p>What you’re going to find below is a write-up of both the good and the bad that we found during our review. We do this so that you can make an educated decision as to which gambling site you should join next.</p>
        <p>The review starts in the next section.</p>

        <Title title={'BetNow.eu Basic Information'}/>
        <p>BetNow.eu has an about page, which is a positive. About pages are important for gambling sites because they tell customers a little bit about what they need to know. There isn’t a TON of information on BetNow’s page, but at least they have one. That’s more than a lot of sites have.</p>
        <p>We can tell you that BetNow.eu started in 2016 and is currently based and licensed in Curacao. They’ve been around for a little while now, but they’re still relatively new as gambling sites go. This makes it tougher to gauge how they’re perceived within the online gambling community as a whole.</p>
        <p>We’ve seen various reports about them, ranging from fast payouts to their customer support asking for passwords. However, there’s no information we found that we’d feel comfortable relying on, much less passing on to you.</p>

        <Title title={'Restricted Countries – Who Can’t Play'}/>
        <p>BetNow’s terms and conditions includes the following list of countries and regions they do not accept players from.</p>

        <Title title={'The Casino'}/>
        <p>Let’s kick off our review with the casino. BetNow.eu offers a basic online casino powered by one or two software providers.</p>
        <p>The first is AST Gaming, a relatively small software provider. The second software provider we thought BetNow worked with was Vivo Gaming for their live casino. Their live dealer games look like ones we’ve reviewed from them in the past.</p>
        <p>However, once we dug into the review, we found that these live dealer games come from Visionary iGaming or ViG Gaming. It definitely threw us off, as they look similar.</p>
        <p>We’re going to talk more about their live casino, as well as their table games, slots, and video poker machines, in the following sections. Keep reading to learn about what BetNow’s casino has to offer.</p>
        <h2>Table Games</h2>
        <p>Unlike other online casinos that run Amigotechs software, there is only one casino here to sort through. This means that you’ll find all their card games under one heading – Table Games.</p>
        <p>The following are the games you’ll find here.</p>

        <div className='border-[2px] border-black px-4'>
          <ul>
            <li> <p>Blackjack Surrender</p></li>
            <li> <p>Multi Hand Blackjack</p></li>
            <li> <p>One Hand Blackjack</p></li>
            <li> <p>Double Exposure Blackjack</p></li>
            <li> <p>Blackjack Switch</p></li>
            <li> <p>Craps</p></li>
            <li> <p>European Roulette</p></li>
            <li> <p>American Roulette</p></li>
            <li> <p>French Roulette</p></li>
            <li> <p>Baccarat</p></li>
            <li> <p>Pai Gow Poker</p></li>
            <li> <p>Poker 3</p></li>
            <li> <p>Caribbean Stud</p></li>
            <li> <p>Keep’em Poker</p></li>
            <li> <p>Crazy Poker</p></li>
            <li> <p>Casino War</p></li>
            <li> <p>Red Dog</p></li>
            <li> <p>Sic Bo</p></li>
            <li> <p>Hoo Hey How</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The variety is pretty good. About half the games here are blackjack variants, though not all of them are unique titles. There are a few multi-hand or multi-deck variants of the games listed above, too.

</p>
        <p>Their non-blackjack selection is also solid. You can play many of the most popular table games, as well as a few dice games. The only complaint we’d imagine people would have is if there’s a specific game or variant you want to play.</p>
        <p>Now, one thing we’re not fans of is the fact that some of their blackjack games pay 6:5 or 1:1 for natural blackjacks. These game offer horrible odds compared to the games that pay 3:2. Fortunately, they have some of the 3:2 games here as well.</p>
        <p>The table stakes are reasonable here. You can play for as little as $1 and for as much as $1,000 for the games we checked out. Each game varies, though.</p>
        <p>Overall, their table game section is a mixed bag. They have a decent selection of games and table stakes. The graphics are good, too. However, they can make some improvements as far as their rules and payouts go.</p>
        <h2>Video Poker</h2>
        <p>Here are the video poker machines that you’ll find at BetNow.eu.</p>

        <div className='border-[2px] border-black px-4'>
          <ul>
            <li> <p>Jacks or Better</p></li>
            <li> <p>Joker Poker</p></li>
            <li> <p>Deuces Wild</p></li>
            <li> <p>Tens or Better</p></li>
            <li> <p>All American</p></li>
            <li> <p>Aces & Eights</p></li>
            <li> <p>Aces & Faces</p></li>
            <li> <p>2 Ways Royal</p></li>
           
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Other than this, you’ll also find multiline – also known as multi-hand – variants of the poker machines listed above.</p>
        <p>This is an okay selection. It covers the bases – the bare minimum you should see from an online casino. They could add more machines if they wanted to, though.</p>
        <p>Like their table games, we couldn’t find a free or play money option. This is disappointing. That said, gambling is usually done for real money, and you could always go elsewhere to play for fun if that’s what you really wanted to do.</p>
        <p>One thing we really liked about their machines is their graphics. If you’ve ever played poker machines from companies like IGT, you know how ugly these games can be. They look like they’re stuck in 1995 using that ugly blue screen from MS-DOS.</p>
        <p>That’s not a problem here. The graphics look great and are easy on the eyes. They’re not fancy like slot machines are, but then again, they’re not supposed to be because they’re poker machines. These are simple yet look great.</p>
        <p>As far as stakes go, you can play for as little as $0.05/coin to as much as $5/coin. This means you can play for anywhere between $0.05 to $25 per round. High rollers may not be happy here, but everyone else will be.

</p>
        <p>Overall, recreational players will probably be pleased here. However, if you care about the house edge at all (which can range from .20% to 13.19%), higher stakes, or a specific variant, you might have to look elsewhere.</p>

        <h2>Slots</h2>
        <p>One of the first things we noticed was an improvement or two in BetNow’s slot section compared to other casinos that run Amigotechs software. Before we get to that, though, let’s look at the different machines you can play here.</p>

        <div className='border-[2px] border-black px-4'>
          <ul>

            <li> <p>Party in Wonderland</p></li>
            <li> <p>Bushido</p></li>
            <li> <p>Dog Father</p></li>
            <li> <p>Kitty Katz</p></li>

            <li> <p>Eye Spy</p></li>
            <li> <p>Lucky 7</p></li>
            <li> <p>And more!
</p></li>
          
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>There are only a couple more machines than what’s listed above, so they have a limited selection compared to what you’ll find at most online casinos.

</p>
        <p>That said, they have a good variety of themes. For example, you can play slots that revolve around themes such as these.</p>

        <div className='border-[2px] border-black px-4'>
          <ul>        
            <li> <p>Sports</p></li>
            <li> <p>Animals</p></li>
            <li> <p>Spies</p></li>
            <li> <p>Hawaii</p></li>
            <li> <p>Ninjas</p></li>
            <li> <p>Car racing</p></li>
            <li> <p>Magic</p></li>
            <li> <p>Fairytales</p></li>
            <li> <p>Outer space</p></li>
            <li> <p>The beach</p></li>
            <li> <p>Italy</p></li>
            <li> <p>Egyptian times</p></li>
            
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>The point is, while there’s not a ton of slot machines to choose from, there’s enough variety here to keep you from getting bored.

</p>
        <p>One of the improvements we noticed over other casinos running the same software is the fact that BetNow.eu has progressive slot machines. The jackpots we found were modest, only ranging from $24,000 to about $35,000. It’s still better than nothing, though.</p>
        <p>Besides, playing for the progressive won’t be for everyone as you have to bet the max in order to win it.

</p>
        <p>Speaking of stakes, you can bet as little as $0.01 per line. However, we noticed that several of their slot machines will have higher minimum limits than this – some as high as $0.10 per line.</p>
        <p>On the high side, you can bet $1 per line. The max number of lines we found was 21 lines, which puts your max bet at $21 per spin. This is low compared to what you can wager at other casinos. This will definitely turn some people off.</p>
        <p>Not everyone will need to play for hundreds of dollars or will need hundreds of machines to choose from. Those people will find plenty of slot machines, themes, jackpots, and slots with features to choose from here.</p>

        <h2>Live Dealer Games</h2>
        <p>BetNow.eu also offers a live dealer casino powered by ViG Gaming. Here are the games you can play.</p>

        <div className='border-[2px] border-black px-4'>
          <ul>       
         
            <li> <p>Blackjack</p></li>
            <li> <p>Early Payout Blackjack</p></li>
            <li> <p>European Roulette</p></li>
            <li> <p>American Roulette</p></li>
            <li> <p>Baccarat</p></li>
            <li> <p>Super6 Baccarat</p></li>
          
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>There are also a couple of variants – namely the person who’s dealing at a particular table. You can choose from both men and women dealers here.</p>
        <p>The first thing we noticed is the table stakes. The minimum stakes are much higher compared to other live dealer casinos, at $5 for blackjack and baccarat and $1 for roulette. The high stakes vary from $1,000 to $5,000 depending on the game, which is lower than what you’ll find elsewhere.</p>
        <p>We checked out a couple of their games during our review. One of them took a long time to load. However, this doesn’t seem to be normal - just a random thing that happened to us.

</p>
        <p>Once we finally got seated, one thing that was neat was that the dealer greeted us by our screen name. This was unexpected and not something that we’ve experienced at other live dealer casinos.</p>
        <p>The stream was pretty good, too. There weren’t any lags. However, we think the picture could be much clearer and brighter. We felt like we were watching the game on an old TV.</p>
        <p>Another area they can improve is the dealers’ ability to speak English. Some of the dealers were hard to understand. However, it seems like the reason for this is because many of the dealers also speak Spanish, so their accents were heavy. We assume they have multilingual dealers so that they can accommodate more than one type of player at a time.</p>
        <p>That’s the extent of our issues in their live dealer casino, though.</p>
        <p>Overall, if you have experience at other live dealer casinos, you might feel underwhelmed here. The stream isn’t as good as it is from other software providers, and they don’t have the features that other live casinos have, either.</p>
        <p>However, if that stuff doesn’t bother you, or if you’re brand new to live games, then these are worth checking out.</p>

        <Title Title={'The Sportsbook'}/>
        <p>Let’s talk about BetNow’s sportsbook next. Here are the sports they were covering during our review.</p>

        <div className='border-[2px] border-black px-4'>
          <ul>
            <li> <p>Football</p></li>
            <li> <p>Baseball</p></li>
            <li> <p>Basketball</p></li>
            <li> <p>Hockey</p></li>
            <li> <p>Golf</p></li>
            <li> <p>Soccer</p></li>
            <li> <p>Auto racing</p></li>
            <li> <p>Tennis</p></li>
            <li> <p>Boxing</p></li>
            <li> <p>Futures</p></li>
            <li> <p>Esports</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>If you clicked on any of these options, then a menu would drop down, giving you additional sub-categories to choose from. For example, you can choose from the following options.</p>

        <div className='border-[2px] border-black px-4'>
          <ul>
            <li> <p>NFL</p></li>
            <li> <p>NCAA Football</p></li>
            <li> <p>CFL</p></li>
            <li> <p>MLB</p></li>
            <li> <p>Japan Baseball</p></li>
            <li> <p>Mexican Baseball League</p></li>
            <li> <p>NBA</p></li>
            <li> <p>Spain ACB</p></li>
            <li> <p>HHL</p></li>
            <li> <p>UEFA Europa League</p></li>
            <li> <p>England – Premier League</p></li>
            <li> <p>England – Championship</p></li>
            <li> <p>Dota 2</p></li>
            <li> <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</p></li>
            <li> <p>King of Glory</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>


        <p>And so on</p>
        <p>One interesting thing we noticed is that, when you land on their sportsbook, you’re not immediately greeted with lines to choose from. You need to select the lines you want to view yourself. You can do this in one of two ways.</p>
        <h3 className='pl-4 font-bold'>Use the “select all” feature and get ALL the lines for ALL the sports/markets</h3>
        <h3 className='pl-4 font-bold'>Manually go through and select the sports and markets you want lines for</h3>
        <p>Then press “View Lines.”</p>
        <p>On one hand, this is useful because you might only bet on one or two sports and don’t want to have to weed through hundreds or thousands of lines to find them. On the other hand, perhaps you bet on several sports, and that’s a lot of options to manually choose yourself.</p>
        <p>Those are your options, though. You’ll have to take it or leave it.</p>
        <p>From here, choosing your bets is pretty easy. Simply select whatever it is you want to bet on, then press the “Add Picks to Ticket” button.</p>
        <p>You can choose from three betting formats for easy viewing, too. Your options include American, Decimal, and Fractional.

</p>
        <p>The site offers live betting on a range of sports, including football, soccer, basketball, and hockey. They also cover football – there just weren’t any football games on during our review.</p>
        <p>Overall, their sportsbook is basic. There aren’t any features or options worth mentioning. That said, their sportsbook works just fine and covers a decent variety of sports and markets.</p>
        <p>It’s hard to find anything wrong with that.</p>

        <h2>Betting Limits and Terms</h2>
        <p>A full list of wagering limits can be found on BetNow’s site. You can bet $1,000 to $10,000 on NFL sides/totals depending on the day of the week. You can also bet as much as $5,000 on NHL, NBA, and NCAA football sides. Then you’ll have a 4-figure max for lesser popular sports, such as auto racing.</p>
        <p>These limits aren’t very high compared to other betting sites but will do for most recreational bettors. This is probably a good thing, as BetNow.eu says in their terms that professionals are prohibited.</p>
        <p>Recreational players will still need a decent bankroll to bet here, though. Their minimum bet is $10, which is 10x higher than most sportsbooks’ $1 minimum. However, you can contact support and have that dropped down to $5.</p>
        <p>Overall, this is an okay online sportsbook for recreational or semi-serious bettors. You won’t find the extensive worldwide coverage (except for soccer and basketball) that you’ll find at other betting sites. However, you’ll still find plenty of American markets and props to keep you busy.

        <Title title={'Esports'}/>
        <p>BetNow.eu does cover esports tournaments. During our review, they had lines for the following esports games.</p>

        <div className='border-[2px] border-black px-4'>
          <ul>         
            <li> <p>Dota 2</p></li>
            <li> <p>League of Legends</p></li>
            <li> <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</p></li>
            <li> <p> StarCraft Brood War</p></li>
            <li> <p>King of Glory</p></li>
            <li> <p>Futures</p></li>
         
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Some of the tournaments or leagues that they cover include the following.</p>

        <div className='border-[2px] border-black px-4'>
          <ul>
            <li> <p>League of Legends – World Championship</p></li>
            <li> <p>King Pro League</p></li>
            <li> <p>Afreeca Starleague</p></li>
            <li> <p>ESEA MDL</p></li>
            <li> <p>PVP Esports Championship</p></li>
           
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>And so on</p>
        <p>They only offered spread, total, and moneyline bets. We didn’t see any betting opportunities where you can bet on outcomes such as the first to x kills, number of headshots, winners of maps, and so on.

</p>
        <p>Ultimately, we feel like their esports section is bare-bones. It’s a little something for people interested in betting on esports but not enough to satisfy hardcore enthusiasts.

</p>

        <Title title={'Banking Options'}/>
        <p>BetNow.eu has several banking options for you to choose from. You’ll find your options for payments and withdrawals in the following two sections.</p>
        <p>All payments are free to make, which is great to see. They also have high deposit limits for both Bitcoin and bank wires. The credit/debit card max limits are on the low side, though. We assume this is to prevent huge losses due to chargebacks.</p>
        <p>So, we’ve got nothing to complain about as far as payments go. However, their cash-outs are a different story.</p>
        <p>The good news about their withdrawals is that you can use Bitcoin. This is going to be a great option for everyone, but especially Americans due to the anonymity factor. It doesn’t hurt that there aren’t any middlemen to get in your way, either.</p>
        <p>That said, one piece of bad news is the limits. The most you can cash out at a time is $3,000, which isn’t very much. You can make multiple cash-outs to get around this. For example, you can request 3 checks for a total of $9,000 per month. This still isn’t a lot, though.</p>
        <p>We did find in their terms that the max you can cash out – regardless of winnings – is $5,000 per week. This is a little better. However, you still need to find a withdrawal method that can handle this. Not only that, but you will also need to factor in the fees you’ll pay.</p>
        <p>The fees will depend on how much you cash out. The more you withdraw, the more fees you’ll pay. You’ll pay as much as $85 in fees, and that doesn’t include the fees your bank will charge you. This is highway robbery.</p>
        <p>We highly recommend you use Bitcoin, as there are no fees to using it. This is on top of all the benefits that come with using crypto to gamble online.</p>
        <p>Withdrawals will be processed within a couple of days. From there, it can take anywhere from a few hours (Bitcoin) to 7-10 days (direct deposit/checks) to get to you. It just depends on the method.</p>
        <p>The following sections will list all the options you can use, the fees you’ll pay, and the minimum and maximum limits you have to work with.</p>
       

     {/*    {/ leave the table /} */}

        <Title title={'Bonus Promotions'}/>
        <p>BetNow.eu has a couple of offers running for both their casino and sportsbook. You’ll find the details for all their offers below.</p>
        <h2>Bonus Promotions</h2>
        <p>BetNow.eu is running a new offer for their sportsbook. On your first deposit you’ll receive a 150% match bonus. This is divided into a 50% free play and 100% cash bonus. The cash bonus has a 15x rollover and the max bonus you can receive is $300. The 50% free play can be used on NFL champ prop bets. This free play is limited to $150 and must be used within 7 days after making your first deposit.

</p>
        <h2>Additional Offers</h2>
        <p>The offers above are BetNow’s only deposit bonuses. However, they have several other offers to check out. The following are the details for each one.</p>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li><p><span className='text-xl font-bold'>Lifetime VIP Program</span>– You’ll be given a specific VIP status based on how much you deposit. Deposit $500, and you’ll receive 10% VIP status. Deposit $2,000, and you’ll receive 15% VIP status. These bonuses are given automatically on all new cash deposits.</p></li>
            <li><p><span className='text-xl font-bold'>Refer-a-Friend</span> – Send your friends to BetNow.eu and get paid for it. You’ll receive a 10% CASH bonus.</p></li>
            <li><p><span className='text-xl font-bold'>Casino Rebate</span>– Receive a 10% rebate on your weekly net losses. You’ll receive your rebate for whatever you lost the previous week (from Monday to Sunday).</p></li>
            <li><p><span className='text-xl font-bold'>Horse Rebate</span> – Receive an 8% rebate on your weekly net losses in their race book from Monday to Sunday.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>That’s it for their evergreen offers. However, they run seasonal promotions, too. For example, during our review, we saw an old promotion for March Madness. They also had several NFL contests and leaderboard promotions you could join.

</p>

        <Title title={'Mobile Friendliness'}/>

        <p>BetNow.eu has a mobile website. No gambling apps needed. Just go to their website from your mobile browser, log in, and you’ll be ready to play.</p>
        <p>They offer far fewer games in their casino compared to their desktop casino. You can choose from 4 video poker and keno games, 6 slot machines, and 9 table games, for a total of 19 casino games. It’s not a lot of games, but it’s better than nothing.</p>
        <p>Their sportsbook works the same way on mobile as it does from your computer, only smaller. Once you choose what lines you want to see, it will load and take up your entire screen. This is probably necessary, though, as it’d be hard to see the lines otherwise.</p>
        <p>The sportsbook was intuitive to use. They also have their betting tutorial in case you don’t understand how to use their site. But if you have any experience betting online, chances are you’ll be fine.

</p>
        <p>We tested their site using a modern smartphone, so Apple and Android users should have no problems here.</p>


        <Title title={'Customer Support'}/>

        <p>You can contact BetNow’s customer support using the following channels.</p>
    {/*     {/ leave theemail /} */}
        <p>We sent them an email to test their support. The question we asked them is whether they have progressive slot machines and, if you win one, if you’ll receive the winnings in full.</p>
        <p>The first response was typical of many online casinos – they wanted our account information.</p>
        <p>We’re not sure what the point of this is, though. Maybe they want to offer us a bonus or something if the activity on our account warrants it? They can go about this in a different way, we think, because a response like this feels like a waste of time when you just want an answer to your question.</p>
        <p>We responded by telling them that we didn’t have an account yet, but that we might sign up based on whether they had progressives or not.</p>
        <p>They responded and told us that they do have progressives in their “Casino ‘Platform 2’ or AST Casino.” We don’t know what either of those casinos are since their casinos aren’t labeled with either description. However, we did manage to find their progressive slot machines.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, they missed or ignored our question about how the winnings are paid. We eventually found the answer for ourselves in their terms and conditions. You can receive no more than $5,000 per week regardless if you win a progressive jackpot.</p>
        <p>We decided not to reply and ask about the payouts since there’s no reason to have so much back and forth for such a simple question. We think this is definitely an area they can improve in.</p>
        <p>That all said, they responded quickly in both cases. That’s definitely good news and worth a virtual high five from us.</p>

        <Title title={'Conclusion – BetNow.eu'}/>
        <p>What did we think of BetNow.eu?</p>
        <p>Well, there are a few things we like about BetNow.eu. For example, we like how they accept Bitcoin and accept relatively high deposit limits for Bitcoin and bank wires. It’s also great news that Bitcoin payments and cash-outs are fee-free.</p>
        <p>We’re also fans of their offers. They give you lots of options, and the more you deposit at one time, the better the playthrough. The playthrough requirements here put most online gambling sites to shame.</p>
        <p>However, there are things we’re not fans of, too.</p>
        <p>For example, we’re not huge fans of their max cash-out limits, and especially the high fees that come with them. They don’t have the casino game variety that other casinos do, either.</p>
        <p>Despite those negatives, though, we’ve not heard of anything that would lead us to believe that BetNow.eu isn’t safe to join.</p>
        <p>There are more established sites out there to choose from. But BetNow.eu is definitely not a site we’d talk you out of joining. Quite the opposite, in fact. This is a site we feel very comfortable recommending.</p>
