    <Header>Expert Review of 10bet.com (Updated for 2022)</Header>
    <Section>
        <Container>
            <p>If you’re looking for an excellent online sportsbook and casino, then you’re going to want to read this 10bet review. 10bet is one of the best betting and casino sites in the UK, Ireland, Sweden, and many other countries.</p>
            <p>If you read some of the older reviews of 10bet, you’ll notice that they mention the casino being small, with only a few dozen games. Fortunately, that has changed. There are now more than 1,000 casino games available.</p>
            <p>The continuous growth is a sign that 10bet listens to its customers and is willing to make modifications based on customer feedback. We want to acknowledge that 10bet did have some issues in the past, but they have addressed many of them to become one of the most trusted online gambling sites available.</p>
            <p>Our review of 10bet will tell you all about these past issues, as well as what to expect from the 10bet sportsbook and online casino. Our review starts below.</p>
            <p>Or, if you’re ready to start gambling at 10bet for real money now, then click the button below to get started.</p>
            <Title title={'Is 10bet Safe and Trustworthy?'}/>
            <p>Before you choose any gambling site, you need to know if it is trustworthy and safe. So, we want to address those concerns first before getting into the meat and potatoes of our 10bet review.</p>

            <div className='bg-[#f5f5f5] p-3'>
                <p>Is 10bet safe? The simple answer is that, yes, we think 10bet is safe and trustworthy. They haven’t been without their issues and complaints (which we’ll cover next), but we have no problems gambling at 10bet.com for money in 2022.</p>
            </div>

            <div className='bg-[#ffefef] p-3'>
            <TextTitle title={'Previous Complaints About 10bet'}/>
                <div>
                    <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/10bet-review-complaints-1.jpg'}/>
                    <p>If you read other 10bet reviews or customer complaints, you may find some comments about people struggling to get their withdrawals from 10bet and other customers experiencing poor customer service. Slow or delayed withdrawals and poor customer service are two major red flags for us.</p>
                    <p>But we did some digging and found out a few things. First of all, most of the customers who have had trouble with slow or delayed withdrawals were people that did not submit verification documents prior to the withdrawal request.</p>
                    <p>10bet has to receive documentation to verify your identity and financial information. This documentation is typically a passport or other ID card and a copy of your credit card or bank statement. Some banking methods require more documentation than others.</p>
                    <p>We understand that some people hesitate to supply this information because they are nervous about their information getting leaked online. But 10bet cannot process withdrawals without receiving this documentation. They also have security measures in place to make sure your information is protected.

</p>
                    <p>So, as far as we are concerned, these complaints about 10bet’s withdrawal process are not valid. 10bet is more secure than other gambling sites because they verify the identity of every customer. When you agree to the site’s terms and conditions, you agree to the verification policy. So the site is legally allowed to deny your withdrawal until that documentation has been submitted.</p>
                    
                </div>
            </div>

            <div className='bg-[#e9ffee] p-3'>
            <TextTitle title={'10bet’s Response to Complaints'}/>
                <div>
                    <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/10bet-review-improvements-1-1.png'}/>
                    <p>As far as the complaints about customer service go, it seems like that has changed in recent years. If you read recent customer reviews of 10bet, many of them speak about the fantastic customer service they received. In addition, the site’s rating on several different review sites has been steadily increasing for years.</p>
                    <p>More importantly, 10bet has proven that it is willing to listen to its customers. The site often responds to customer service complaints on forums like Trustpilot. And they have expanded the casino games and betting markets that they offer because of complaints on other 10bet reviews.

</p>
                    <p>That dedication and willingness to work with its customers is the number one reason we can confidently say that 10bet is a secure online casino.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Additional Information About 10bet'}/>
            <p>If you are still on the fence about 10bet, it might help to have a little bit more information about the site and the company that operates it.

</p>
            <p>10bet launched in 2003, so it is coming up on two decades of experience in the online gambling industry. Blue Star Planet Limited is the company that owns 10bet. Ocean Star Limited is a subsidiary of Blue Star Planet Limited that is registered in Malta.</p>
            {/* leave the key */}

            <p>10bet is the only site operated by Blue Star Planet Limited and its subsidiaries. So, there are no sister sites that operate the same way as 10bet.</p>
            <p>There are several options available for contacting customer service. You can call the telephone support number at +356 2778 0155 or email them at support@10bet.com. Live chat is also available, but you must be logged in to access it.</p>
            <p>Some 10bet reviews claim that the live chat response is slow and unhelpful, but that was not the case for us. We received helpful answers to our questions within a few minutes of logging on.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Restricted Countries'}/>
            <p>One example of the standards that 10bet has to meet to maintain its gambling license is restricting access for customers in certain locations. Here is an updated list of the restricted countries that are not allowed to access 10bet for real money gambling.</p>

            <div>

            </div>
            <Title title={'Review of the 10bet Sportsbook'}/>
            <p>The 10bet sportsbook uses SBTech software, which gives you access to a massive collection of betting markets. There are more than 65,000 betting markets on 10bet every month, plus 25,000 in-play betting options. Here are some of the unique sports betting options we found during our review of the 10bet sportsbook.</p>
            <div>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Handball'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Motor Racing'}/>

            </div>
            <p>Because 10bet started as a European-centered sportsbook, the site covers most of the major sporting events across Europe. But they have also added international sports, such as bandy, Aussie rules, and snooker. You can also bet on politics and entertainment events from around the world.</p>
            <p>Football (soccer) is the most prominent sport for online betting at 10bet. The site has 37 countries represented in its football betting options, including Ethiopia, Qatar, and Egypt. In addition, some of those countries have multiple leagues that you can bet on.</p>
            <p>For example, La Liga is the most prominent football league in Spain. 10bet covers La Liga, Segunda, Copa del Rey, Superliga Women, Segunda RFEF G4, Tercera RFEF, and the youth league. You will always have betting options for prominent leagues like La Liga, but 10bet stands out because it accepts bets on so many other leagues.</p>
            <TextTitle title={'Betting Features on 10bet'}/>
            <p>The wide variety of betting markets is one reason that 10bet is such a popular online sportsbook. But that is not the only reason people love this betting site. There are also several features we found while reviewing 10bet that will enhance your betting experience.</p>
            <div>
            <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/review-4-300x125-1.jpg'}/>

            </div>
            <p>We were very pleased to find all of these features during our 10bet online sportsbook review. Many betting sites have some of these features, but it is rare to find one site that has all of them.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, one feature that 10bet does not offer is live streaming. We have a list of other betting sites with live streaming if that’s a deal-breaker for you.</p>
            <p>Other than that, there is a lot to love about the 10bet sportsbook. The wide variety of betting markets, special betting features, and unique wager types really make this betting site stand out as one of the best.
</p>
            <Title title={'10bet Casino Review'}/>
            <p>While 10bet is known for sports betting, you don’t want to miss out on the casino either. The online casino at 10bet has so much to offer, including more than one thousand games from multiple software providers.</p>
            <p>You can play games from Microgaming, Evolution, NetEnt, Playson, Pragmatic Play, and many others. These software providers are the best in the business so that you can access all the best slots and table games.</p>
            <p>However, some games and software providers are not available in every country. For example, 10bet UK offers 694 slots, but in another country you might find 800+ slots. So if you can’t find a specific game, it might be because it is not available in your location.</p>
            <p>Luckily, 10bet makes it really easy to find the games you are interested in. Several game categories are listed at the top of the casino page, including slots, jackpots, table and card games, and Drops and Wins. They also have seasonal categories so that you can find games with holiday themes.</p>
            <p>Here is some more information about the casino games available on 10bet.com.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Slot Machines and Progressive Jackpots on 10bet'}/>
            <p>With hundreds of slot machines, you have plenty of games to choose from. 10bet casino has everything from Juicy Fruits to Gold Digger Megaways.</p>
            <p>You can also enjoy branded games from Microgaming and NetEnt. Some of the most popular branded games include Gordan Ramsay Hell’s Kitchen, Starburst Xxxtreme, Guns N’ Roses, and Game of Thrones.
</p>
            <div>
            <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/review-6-300x125-1.jpg'}/>
                <p>Because there is such a wide variety of games available, you can find dozens of slots with different features. Try Gonzo’s Quest or Lara Croft Temples and Tombs if you like cascading reels. Immortal Romance is an excellent choice when you want a game with multiple bonus rounds. </p>
                <p>Of course, one of the most enticing slot features is a progressive jackpot. There are 25 different progressive jackpots available in the online casino at 10bet. Sixteen of those games are from Microgaming, and another four are from NetEnt. The remaining five come from other software providers that only have one jackpot game to offer.</p>
                <p>Microgaming is known for breaking the world record of the highest online jackpot ever paid, but NetEnt held that title before. So, the majority of jackpot games on 10bet come from the two software providers that are best known for progressive jackpots. That is good news for you!</p>
                <p>Mega Moolah is the most popular progressive jackpot because that is the one that has broken world records. 10bet offers five different games on the Mega Moolah network, including The Witches Moon and Fortunium Gold.</p>
                <p>We could not find any policies about progressive jackpot payouts during our review of the 10bet casino. However, Microgaming has a strict policy that all jackpot prizes get paid out in full as soon as the win has been verified.</p>
                <p>So, as long as you play progressive slots from Microgaming, you should be able to get your total prize in a single payment, even if your prize amount is higher than the withdrawal limits. 10bet may issue installments for progressive jackpots from other software providers.</p>

            </div>

            <TextTitle title={'10 Bet’s Table Games'}/>
            <div>
            <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/review-7-300x168-1.jpg'}/>
                <p>We found several 10bet reviews that mention a limited selection of table games, but we did not find that to be the case. There are more than 40 table games available on 10bet.</p>
                <p>You can enjoy fifteen different variations of roulette. Some of the variants simply have different betting limits, like 20p roulette. Other variants include unique themes, like the real spooky roulette with a Halloween theme.</p>
                <p>If you prefer blackjack, you can enjoy fourteen different options. For example, lightning blackjack has random multipliers that help you win even more. Or you can choose European blackjack, Vegas Downtown blackjack, or Vegas Strip blackjack. Each variant has slightly different rules and payouts.</p>
                <p>10bet also offers punto banco, craps, baccarat, and three types of dragon tiger. We think that is a pretty solid collection of table games. But if you are looking for even more options, 10bet has an excellent live casino.</p>

            </div>

            <TextTitle title={'Live Dealer Casino Games on 10bet'}/>
            <p>You can find some of the live dealer casino games, including live game shows, listed in the casino lobby. But the best way to explore the live dealer casino on 10bet is to click the Live Casino tab at the top of the page.</p>
            <p>Once you get to the live casino lobby, you can use the tabs to view different live game categories. They include live blackjack, live roulette, live baccarat and sic bo, live poker, and live game shows. Or, if you prefer, you can see a list of all the live casino options in one place.</p>
            <div>
            <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/review-7-300x168-1.jpg'}/>
                <p>There are more than 35 games available in the live casino, including nine options for live roulette and fourteen live blackjack variants.</p>
                <p>All of the live dealer casino games come from Evolution Gaming. 10bet could offer even more live games if they included live games from Microgaming or Pragmatic Play Live.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, Evolution is the most popular live casino provider. Evolution is known for lightning games that include random multipliers. You can play lightning roulette, lightning dice, and lightning blackjack.</p>
                <p>Another reason that Evolution Gaming is so popular is because of all the unique game shows that they offer. Each game show features a live host that interacts with the players and adds excitement. They include games like Mega Ball, Dream Catcher, Gonzo’s Treasure Hunt, Football Studio, and absolute hit Crazy Time.</p>
                <p>Overall, we were very impressed during our 10bet online casino review. The site has so much to offer, including the best progressive jackpots, popular live dealer games, and a decent collection of digital table games. In addition, all of the games are well-organized, so it is easy to find the games you want to play.</p>
                <p>However, a few games are missing. 10bet does not have any specialty games, so you can’t play bingo, keno, or scratch cards. There is only one video poker option, and the selection of other poker games is also limited.</p>
                <p>If 10bet added some specialty games and expanded its poker collection, it could be one of the best online casinos available.</p>

            </div>

            <Title title={'10bet Mobile Gambling Options'}/>
            <p>10bet will appreciate you washing your hands before touching the 10bet app because the thing is brand new. They had an app which was really great, but then they probably decided that (really great) is boring and created the real deal. They love it, we love it, you’ll probably love it too.</p>
            <p>You can take 10bet with you anywhere you go because 10bet has multiple options for mobile gambling. Here are the different ways you can access the site from your phone, tablet, or any other internet-enabled device.</p>

            <div className='bg-[#f5f5f5] px-2 py-4'>
            <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/review-9-300x168-1.jpg'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} title={'iOS App'} desc={'- You can download the 10bet app on iPhone, iPad, or any other iOS device. The iOS app is designed for Apple users and gives you complete access to the 10bet sportsbook and casino site.'}/>

            </div>
            <p>No matter which option you choose, you will be able to play casino games and bet on all the different sports mentioned in our 10bet betting site review. The mobile app will have all have the same features and gambling options available on their main site.

</p>
            <p>The only difference between the iOS app and the Android app is the types of devices you can use it on. Similarly, the only difference between the gambling apps and the mobile site is how you access them. There might be a few minor differences in how things are displayed, but everything else will be the same.

</p>
            <p>If you have tried the 10bet app before or read a negative review of the 10bet sportsbook app, you might want to give it another chance. 10bet has offered downloadable apps for many years, but many customers complained about slow loading times and needing to log in multiple times.</p>

            <Borderedbox>
                <p>True to form, 10bet paid attention to those complaints and decided to do something about them. They released a new version of their app that is faster and easier to use. The new sportsbook app loads within seconds, and so do the casino games.</p>
            </Borderedbox>
            <p>Whether you decide to download an app or simply visit the mobile site, 10bet makes it easy to enjoy everything the site offers while you are on the go. If you want to know more about it, then read our review of the 10bet app.</p>

            <Title title={'Deposits and Withdrawals on 10bet'}/>
            <p>Before you can start playing at 10bet with real money, you need to fund your account. Fortunately, there are several convenient ways you can deposit and withdraw from 10bet. Here are the options that we found during our 10bet.com review.</p>

            {/* leave the table */}
            <p>10bet doesn’t charge transaction fees most of the time. However, you may have to pay a transaction fee if you make several withdrawals in a short amount of time. For example, you may be subject to transaction fees if you make more than one credit card withdrawal in 30 days.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that you may also have to pay fees that your bank or credit card company charges. Those charges are out of 10bet’s control, but you don’t want to pay site-based fees in addition to the ones from your financial institution.</p>
            <p>Whenever possible, you must request a withdrawal using the same banking method you used to make a deposit. 10bet may change your withdrawal method or deny your request if you try to withdraw with a different banking method.</p>
            <p>It is critical to have your account verification completed before you request a withdrawal. The verification documentation may vary based on the banking method used. You may need to reach out to customer service to have them check that your account has been verified.

</p>
            <p>Make sure that all the accounts you use for banking on 10bet are in your name. If the name on the account doesn’t match the name you used when you created your 10bet account, your withdrawals will be denied, and your account could get locked.</p>
            <Borderedbox>
                <p>As long as you keep these policies and procedures in mind, you should be able to avoid the common issues customers tend to complain about in their negative (and not-so-fair) 10bet reviews.
</p>
            </Borderedbox>
            <p>The bottom line - 10bet has plenty of banking options and reasonable limits that should work for most customers.</p>

            <Title title={'Reviewing 10bet Promotions and Rewards'}/>
            <p>We found several promotions that were available during our review of 10bet. You can choose one of two welcome bonuses based on whether you want to use the bonus for sports betting or casino games.</p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} title={'Casino Welcome Bonus '} desc={'- Joining 10bet will get you a 100% up to £100 welcome bonus and the casino bonus is even crispier, because it gives you 25 free spins.'}/>

            <p>These welcome bonuses are just the beginning. 10bet has a fantastic collection of additional promotions that reward you for using the site. You can choose the bonuses that work best for you based on the types of gambling that you enjoy. Here are some examples of additional promos from 10bet.</p>
            <div className='bg-[#fff5ff] px-2 py-4'>

            <p>Most of these offers change weekly or monthly, so it is a good idea to visit the promotions page regularly to see what offers are available.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'The Ten Club'}/>
            <p>10bet also has a rewarding program for selected customers, called The Ten Club. It is very different from the tiered loyalty programs you might be used to.
</p>
            <div>
                <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/10bet-review-ten-club-loyalty-program-1-1.png'}/>
                <p>First of all, the Ten Club is not open to every 10bet customer. In fact, only 1,000 bettors can be in the Ten Club at a time. You must receive an invitation from the 10bet team to join the Ten Club.</p>
                <p>There is no information about what you have to do to qualify for a Ten Club invitation, but 10bet claims to work within each members’ affordable levels. That makes us think that the program is open to low- and high-stakes gamblers alike, but we can’t be sure.</p>
                <p>If you get invited to the Ten Club, you will automatically receive various rewards. The rewards include a dedicated account manager, a private WhatsApp number for customer service, lower rollover requirements, exclusive tournaments, and hospitality events. You may also get special deals, promotions, or gifts like free bets and merchandise.</p>
                <p>We can’t tell you the exact benefits of joining the Ten Club because 10bet does not make that information available to the public. Most online gambling sites tell you all about their loyalty program because they see it as an incentive to join the site.</p>
                <p>10bet does the opposite. By keeping information about the qualifications and rewards secret, 10bet can customize the rewards for each customer. For example, they may have different rewards for gamblers with different budgets or gambling preferences.</p>
                <p>The Ten Club seems to be a valuable program that offers various benefits to different customers. But we can’t really offer a complete review of the 10bet loyalty program without being able to experience it firsthand.</p>
