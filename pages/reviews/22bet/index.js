    <Header>22Bet Review – Is 22Bet Legit?</Header>
    <Section>
      <Container>
        <p>If you are looking for a gambling site that has it all, look no further than 22Bet. This top-rated gambling site has sports betting, casino games, live bingo, virtual sports, and dozens of specialty games. With so much to offer, 22Bet has something for everyone.

</p>
        <p>In keeping with that theme, the site also has bonuses for everyone. You can get different bonuses for sports betting and casino games. They even have shop bonuses where you can exchange your loyalty points for free bets, spins, and merchandise.</p>
        <p>While 22Bet definitely has a lot to offer, the site still has a few weaknesses. We want you to know both the good and the bad before you start using 22Bet for yourself. That is why we will cover it all in this 22Bet review.

</p>
        <p>We will start by exploring the online casino at 22Bet and the site’s sports betting options. Then we will explore the banking methods and bonuses available. Our comprehensive review wouldn’t be complete without some background information about the site and the company that operates it.

</p>
        <p>By the time you get done reading this review of 22Bet, you will know everything you need to about the site. Of course, you can also jump right in by clicking the link above if you want to start gambling right away or jump to a specific section. Either way, this review is your resource for 22Bet information.</p>

        <Title title={'Review of the 22Bet Casino'}/>
        <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/22bet-review-casino-section-1.jpg'}/>
        <p>22Bet has a massive casino with thousands of casino games. We looked through around 3,000 of them, and we still hadn’t even reached the end of the list. Everyone will be able to find games that appeal to them.

</p>
        <p>These games come from more than 100 different software providers, including Spinomenal, Pragmatic Play, Betsoft, and iSoftBet. While 22Bet has some games from each provider, they are not necessarily represented equally. For example, we noticed several older games from Microgaming, but the site doesn’t have their newer games. You can play Avalon, but the newer Avalon II game isn’t available.</p>
        <p>Betsoft, Spinomenal, Pragmatic Play, and 1Spin4Win seem to be the software providers that make up the bulk of the online casino games. But that could change as 22Bet adds new games and software providers regularly.

</p>
        <p>Let’s take a closer look at some of the games available on 22Bet. We will separate our review of the 22Bet casino into a few categories so you can find out about the games that most appeal to you.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Slot Machines and Progressive Jackpots on 22Bet'}/>
        <p>Like most online casinos, the vast majority of the thousands of games on 22Bet are slots. The site has plenty of classic favorites, such as Mystic Hive, Sweet Bonanza, and Book of Darkness. But you will also find dozens of games you probably have never heard of. Demi-Gods III, Rooster Rumble, and Cthulhu Secret were some of the games we discovered for the first time during our 22Bet online casino review.

</p>
        <p>You will find more than 400 jackpot games in the mix. Each game and software provider handles jackpots differently. So, some games have jackpots that offer a few thousand dollars as the top prize, while others offer six or seven-figure prizes. Here are a few of the jackpots that were available during our 22Bet.com review. We have included the jackpot prizes so you can see the variety, but remember that the jackpot amounts change constantly.</p>
   {/*      {/ table /} */}
        <p>As you can see, there are many differences between the various jackpot games available. For example, winning the top prize on King Tut would be significantly less exciting than winning the jackpot on Fire Strike 2. However, you might have better odds of winning, especially if you don’t want to bet the max amount. We recommend trying several jackpot games so you can find a few you like.</p>
        <p>We have one complaint about the online casino at 22Bet. The problem with having so many games available is that it is difficult to organize them. Unfortunately, 22Bet has not found a good solution to this problem. Their games are not alphabetized, and we can’t figure out the method they used to sort them.</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p>If you have a specific game you are looking for, you shouldn’t have a problem.</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>There is a search box on the top right side of the screen that you can use to find your game quickly. But you are kind of out of luck if you don’t have a specific game in mind.</p>
        <p>There are a few categories on the left-hand side, so you can see the newest games, the most popular, or games with a jackpot. You can also use the Drops and Wins category to see the qualifying games for the weekly tournament.</p>
        <p>Underneath those filters, there are also a few buttons that will allow you to filter the games by the software provider. At first glance, it looks like only three software providers are available, but if you hover your mouse near that list, a scroll bar will pop up. You can use it to scroll through all the software providers.</p>
        <p>Filtering the games by software provider is probably the easiest way to discover new games you may enjoy. The more you play games from each provider, the more you will identify the ones you like. For example, Betsoft games are known for fantastic 3D graphics, while NetEnt slots typically have a high return to player (RTP) percentages. You can learn more about the most popular software providers here.

</p>
        <p>We would love to see 22Bet add a few game filters to make it easier to find your favorite games. For example, they could allow you to filter games by the number of pay lines, themes, or different bonus features. However, as long as you don’t mind scrolling through a bunch of games, you should be impressed by the slots collection on 22Bet.

</p>
        <p></p>

        <TextTitle title={'What Live Table Games Can I Play on 22Bet?'}/>
        <p>If you love playing live casino games, you will love 22Bet for sure. This site has one of the largest live casinos we have ever seen, with live games from eighteen different live studios. You can play games from major studios, like Pragmatic Play and Vivo Gaming, as well as smaller providers such as N2Live and Fazi.</p>
        <div>
          <Cornerimage src={'/image/reviews/22bet-review-live-table-game-1.png'}/>
          <p>Fortunately, the live casino is much more organized than the slots section of the site. You can filter the games into several categories, including roulette, blackjack, poker, and baccarat. There are also some less common categories, such as dragon tiger, Hindi-style, game shows, and live Drops and Wins. Or you can use the speeds category to find faster versions of popular live games.</p>
          <p>All of these options ensure that you will always have a few different live games you will be interested in. You can explore various games from different providers to see which dealers, game rules, and studios you like best.</p>
          <p>Some providers even have different options for the same game. For example, Pragmatic Play has twelve different roulette games. You can play roulette with two dealers, choose the dealer’s language, or simply choose from different studio backgrounds.</p>
          <p>One of the features that stood out to us most during our 22Bet casino review is that you can play some live games for free. Most casinos only offer free play on their digital games, but 22Bet breaks the mold. This option is only available on certain games. If free play is available, you will see a “play for free” button appears when you hover over the game title. </p>
        </div>

        <div className='bg-[#e9ffee]'>
          <h1>What about digital table games and video poker?</h1>
          <p>22Bet has many digital table games and video poker available, but you won’t find them listed under the casino tab. If you want to play blackjack, roulette, baccarat, or other table games without a live dealer, click the slots tab. The digital table games and video poker options are mixed in with the slots list. We recommend searching for a specific game you want to play to find them quickly.</p>
        </div>
        <Title title={'22Bet Sportsbook Review'}/>
        <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/22bet-review-sports-section-1.jpg'}/>
        <p>Sports bettors will love all the options for online betting at 22Bet. The bookmaker covers more than fifty different sports and other events. Of course, you can bet on the most popular sports like football, basketball, and hockey. But 22Bet goes beyond the ordinary. Here are some of the unique betting markets that are available.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Chess'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Futsal'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Badminton'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Water Polo'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'TV games (including award shows, cinema, and WWE betting)'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Darts'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Beach Soccer'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Netball'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Hurling'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Weather'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Kabaddi'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Muay Thai'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Kun Khmer'}/>
        </div>
        <p>The site also has an entire section dedicated to long-term bets where you can bet on championships for 30 different sports. You can bet on the Super Bowl, the World Cup, and other events up to a year in advance. These future bets can be risky, especially if you don’t know how the team will perform at the beginning of the season. But they are also a great way to get some of the best odds if you are confident.</p>
        <p>Another exciting option is to use the live betting feature to bet on events as they are happening. You have to click the live button at the top of the screen because the live betting options are separate from the regular sportsbook. Live betting gives you additional opportunities, such as betting on which team will score next or what calls the refs will make during the game.

</p>
        <p>Anyone can enjoy betting on sports on 22Bet.com. The site is not only organized and easy to use but also has incredible wagering limits. You can bet on sports with as little as $0.20, and high-stakes bettors can spend as much as $600,000. This wide range of betting limits will appeal to everyone.</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p>There is only one thing that we were disappointed with during our 22Bet sportsbook review. The site lacks some of the best betting features.</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>You cannot live stream events, there are no bet builders, and enhanced odds are rarely available. We would love to see 22Bet add some of these features in the future.</p>
        <TextTitle title={'Esports Betting'}/>
        <p>22Bet has an exceptional sportsbook for esports. You can bet on video game competitions for Counterstrike, Mortal Kombat, FIFA, and Esports ice hockey. The site even offers betting on Marble-live games, or you can bet on whether a player will beat the house at casino games.

</p>
        <p>Because there are so many betting options, the esports bookmaker is separate from the main sportsbook. To access esports betting, you will need to click more in the top menu bar and then click esports.</p>
        <p>We were incredibly impressed with the esports betting options during our 22Bet online sportsbook review. They have more esports options than any other site we have reviewed, including live betting options.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Virtual Sports'}/>
        <p>If you want to bet on your favorite sport when it is out of season, you may want to consider virtual sports betting. Virtual sports allow you to bet on fictional sports. Random number generator (RNG) software determines each event’s outcome.

</p>
        <p>We found virtual sports betting options from seven different providers during our 22Bet betting site review. Here is an overview of the virtual sports options from each of these providers.</p>
      {/*   {/ leave the table /} */}
        <p>These virtual sports options are incredible. Most sportsbooks only have one provider for virtual sports and only a handful of betting options. 22Bet has nearly 100 different options from seven different providers. It is another example of how far the site is willing to go to ensure its customers have the most betting options and the best possible experience.</p>

        <Title title={'Other Gambling Options on 22Bet.com'}/>
        <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/22bet-review-other-gambling-options-1.jpg'}/>
        <p>If you were impressed during our review of 22Bet’s sportsbook and casino, you will be even more excited to learn that the site has more to offer. The main navigational menu at the top of the page has a more button. When you click it, you can access bingo, 22Games, TV games, and fast games. Here is a little information about these options.</p>

        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bingo- Similar to the virtual sports section, the bingo option has bingo games from 10 different software providers. Click on a provider to see what they offer. You can play bingo games with a live dealer, animated bingo games, and even keno. Choose from dozens of options with various themes, features, and formats.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'22Games- This section of the site offers a wide variety of instant play casino and specialty games, such as dice games, scratch cards, poker light, and additional slots. These games are separated because you can earn and use bonus points on these games by completing challenges.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'TV Games- Use the TV games section to play live lotto games. A live dealer completes a lotto draw every one, three, seven, and ten minutes. There are four studios, and each one has different games, dealers, and features.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Fast Games- There are even more specialty games in the fast games section. You can play arcade games, provably fair games, board games, Plinko, and even Yatzy. These games are fun to play, even if they don’t fit into traditional casino categories.'}/>
        </div>
        <p>22Bet doesn’t need these additional gambling options. In fact, most of the other gambling sites we recommend don’t include anything like this. The fact that 22Bet goes to the effort of including so many additional options proves that the site is dedicated to entertaining its customers.</p>
        <p>There is something for everyone in each of these sections. Even if you don’t normally play bingo or other specialty games, you may find a nostalgic game you enjoy. For example, who can forget playing minesweeper on their first computer? You can relive those experiences thanks to the extra games that 22Bet offers.</p>

        <Title title={'Download the 22Bet Mobile Gambling App'}/>
        <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/22bet-review-downloading-gambling-app-1.jpg'}/>
        <p>Because 22Bet has so much to offer, you could play for hours on end without ever running out of new gambling options to try. The 22Bet app has all of those same options, and it is even more convenient because you can play it anywhere. This section of our 22Bet review will tell you all about the ways you can access 22Bet on your mobile devices.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'How Do I Download the 22Bet App?'}/>
        <p>22Bet is one of the rare online gambling sites that has created a true downloadable app. There are two versions of the app, so you can download it on your iPhone or Android devices. We recommend downloading the app directly from the site.</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p>You can also search for it in the App Store or the Google Play store. However, we found several other apps that might confuse you. For example, one app uses the 22Bet logo, but it is merely informational, so you can’t use it to bet on sports or play casino games.</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>Of course, you can also use your mobile internet browser to access 22Bet.com without downloading anything. That is the best option for anyone using a Blackberry or Windows device. The mobile gambling site has all the same sports markets and casino games. If you plan on using it frequently, we recommend bookmarking the mobile site for easy access.</p>
        <TextTitle title={'22Bet vs. Mobile Site'}/>
        <p>Most of the time, we would say that the differences between mobile sites and downloadable apps are negligible. It usually just comes down to a preference about whether or not you want to download something. But in the case of the 22Bet app, we actually recommend you download it.</p>
        <p>The reason that we preferred the downloadable app is that it is more organized and easier to navigate. That is especially true for casino players. If you access 22Bet.com from your mobile browser, you will have the same options for filtering slot games. You can scroll through a list of 100 software providers or choose categories like new and popular games.</p>
        <p>But when you download the 22Bet app, you have additional ways to filter the games. For example, click the categories button at the bottom of the casino screen. From there, you get game categories like poker, roulette, blackjack, 3D slots, mega ways, keno, bonus buys, games with cascading symbols, and cluster pays. There is even a category for all of the games with “book of” titles. </p>
        <p>There is also a separate tab where you can browse the software providers. This tab displays each provider’s logo, which is helpful. If you forget the name of the company that created a game you like, you may be able to recognize the logo better. The names of the software providers are also listed under the game title on the app, which is helpful.</p>
        <p>It still comes down to personal preference because both the app and the mobile site have a lot to offer. We were impressed with both options during our 22Bet reviews, but the app stood out from an organizational perspective.</p>

        <Title title={'How to Claim the 22Bet Welcome Bonus'}/>
        <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/22bet-review-bonuses-section-1.jpg'}/>
        <p>Before you start enjoying all of the wonderful gambling options that 22Bet offers, don’t forget to explore the site’s bonuses page. There are different bonuses available, and they are conveniently sorted by the type of gambling that you prefer.</p>
        <p>We will go over the different options for casino players and sports bettors next. But first, we have an important disclaimer. 22Bet doesn’t offer bonuses to players who use cryptocurrency to fund their accounts. So you will definitely want to consider that before making your first deposit.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'22Bet Casino Bonuses'}/>
        <p>Casino players have two bonuses available. First, you get a generous welcome bonus when you make your first deposit. After that, you can enter the weekly casino race. We will cover each of these briefly in this section of our 22Bet casino review.

</p>
        <p>When you make your first deposit of at least C$2, you can get a 100% deposit match of up to C$450. This bonus has a 50x wagering requirement, but it only applies to the bonus amount. So, the maximum wagering requirement is $22,500 if you claim the maximum bonus.</p>
        <p>There is another benefit to the welcome bonus. As long as the bonus is active, every bet you place on the games in the 22games category gets doubled. For example, if you place a $2.50 bet, the game will automatically double it so that it appears you played $5. The doubled amount determines your prizes. So, if you won a prize of 10x your bet amount, you would win $50 instead of $25.</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p></p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>Of course, there are some restrictions. Your wagers will not be doubled on certain games, such as African roulette, minesweeper, and Royal Feast. It is also important to understand that the doubled amount does not count toward your wagering requirement, and you still have to stick to the maximum bet of $5.</p>
        <p>The best part of the casino welcome bonus on 22Bet is that it is easy to claim. Your bonus cash will automatically be added to your account as soon as you finish your first deposit. Just make sure that you don’t click the box that says “I do not want any bonuses” when you are creating your account.

</p>
        <p>After you have cleared the wagering requirement on your welcome bonus, you can join the casino race. It is a weekly slots tournament with a €10,000 prize pool. You earn 100 leaderboard points for every euro/dollar you wager on any 22Bet slot game during the week. The prize pool is divided between the top 100 players.</p>
        <p>Those are the only public bonuses for casino players on 22Bet. However, the site may send out additional promotions via email or messages on your player account.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Bonuses for 22Bet Sports Bettors'}/>
        <p>Sports bettors have several more options for bonuses than casino players on 22Bet. So, let’s start with the sports welcome bonus, and then we will briefly explore other sports promotions.</p>
        <p>The sports welcome bonus on 22Bet is a 100% deposit match of up to C$300. You have to deposit at least C$2 to qualify for the bonus. There is a wagering requirement of 5x the bonus amount. In order to count toward the wagering requirement, you must place accumulator bets with at least three selections. Those selections must have odds of 1.40 or higher.</p>

        {/* {/ leave the tips /} */}

        <p>Just like the casino welcome bonus, the sports bonus doesn’t have any bonus code. It will be added to your account as soon as you finish your first deposit. There will be a box on the deposit screen that allows you to choose whether you want to use the bonus for sports betting or casino games.</p>
        <p>After you have met the wagering requirement on the sports welcome bonus, you will have plenty of other promotions to choose from. 22Bet offers reload bonuses for sports bettors, weekly rebates, daily accumulator promos, and bet boosts for accumulators with seven or more selections. Check out the bonuses page for more information.</p>

        <Title title={'How to Deposit and Withdraw on 22Bet'}/>
        <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/22bet-review-banking-methods-1.jpg'}/>
        <p>Getting your money to and from your online gambling account is one of the most important aspects of gambling online. Unfortunately, many gamblers have horror stories of delayed payments, transaction fees, or other headaches. The good news is that you shouldn’t have those problems when you use 22Bet.</p>
        <p>This site has more than 140 banking methods you can use for your deposits and at least 70 options for withdrawals. These options include credit cards, e-wallets, cryptocurrency, bank transfers, vouchers and more.

</p>
        <p>You may notice that you have more or fewer banking options than we mentioned. That is because 22Bet has dozens of different banking methods that are location specific. Here are a few location-specific banking examples.</p>

        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Express Union Cameroon'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Russian Post'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Wizall Senegal'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Banco de Chile'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Banco de Brasil'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'China Union Pay'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Local bank transfers for Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam'}/>

        </div>
        <p>Those are just a few examples that are designated for specific locations. Because the banking options vary by location, you may find inconsistent banking methods listed on other reviews of 22Bet. Each review will list the banking methods available in their location. You will have to log in to your account to find out the exact banking options for your area.</p>
        <p>The good news is that no matter where you are, you will have plenty of options to choose from. Best of all, 22Bet never charges transaction fees on any deposits or withdrawals, no matter which banking method you choose.</p>
        <p>Processing times for withdrawals may vary based on your location and the banking methods you choose. But in most cases, 22Bet will process your withdrawal within an hour. As long as you choose a digital banking method, such as e-wallets or cryptocurrency, you can get your money as soon as 22Bet approves it.</p>

        <Title title={'Is 22Bet.com Legit?'}/>
        <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/22bet-review-is-it-legit-1.jpg'}/>
        <p>We have covered a lot of information about the site in this 22Bet.com review. However, before we wrap it up with some frequently asked questions, we want to give you a little information about the company that operates this site.

</p>
        <p>Many people want to know, “is 22Bet legit,” or “is it safe to bet on 22Bet.” The best way to answer these questions is to look at all aspects of the company.</p>
        <p>TechSolutions Group N.V. is the company that operates 22Bet.com. The company also operates a few other sites, including National Casino, Bizzo Casino, and 20Bet.</p>

        <Borderedbox>
          <p>All of these sites are well-trusted and reputable sites that come highly recommended. Because the same company owns all of them, you can expect that 22Bet will meet the same standards as its sister sites.</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>The Kahnawake Gaming Commission licenses 22Bet.com. We found several other reviews of 22Bet that stated the Curacao eGaming Authority licensed the site.</p>
        <p>Most likely, the site has different gaming licenses for each country where it operates. We verified the Kahnawake license for our 22Bet Canada review. But it is still possible that the site is licensed by Curacao for operation in other countries. It is also worth pointing out that the main TechSolutions office is in Curacao.</p>
        <p>Either way, you can rest assured that 22Bet is a legitimate gambling site because it is licensed by at least one gambling authority. The site must meet the standards set by the gaming commission, including fair gaming and player protection standards.</p>
        <p>22Bet has an excellent reputation with its customers. The site’s dedication to its customers is evident in the number of gambling options they offer, the number of convenient banking options, and the fantastic mobile apps. They go above and beyond to ensure their customers have the best experience possible, which is why the site has such a positive reputation.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Restricted Countries'}/>
        <p>There are a few countries where access to 22Bet is restricted. The site will automatically block access to any customers who attempt to access it from one of these countries. Remember, it is always your responsibility to verify the online gambling laws in your location before using any online gambling site.</p>
