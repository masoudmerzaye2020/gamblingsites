            If you are looking for a new casino, you will want to consider
            checking out DuckyLuck.ag. You can play hundreds of games from ten
            different software providers, including Betsoft, Rival Gaming, and
            Qora slots. Their games include slots, table games, live dealer
            games, and even specialty options, like bingo and keno.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to their fantastic game collection, Ducky Luck also has
            several enticing promotions. Their welcome bonus offers a 500%
            deposit match, which is the highest match percentage we have seen
            online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ducky Luck Casino also makes it easy to fund your account and get
            your winnings. They have several cryptocurrency, credit card, and
            e-wallet banking options, so you can choose which method is most
            convenient for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, there are also a few things that Ducky Luck doesn’t do
            well. Keep reading this Ducky Luck review to learn all about the
            site. We will cover everything from the games available to the
            customer service, including details you won’t find on any other
            Ducky Luck reviews. Before we dive in, here is some crucial
            information about the site.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Review of Ducky Luck Casino Games"} />
          <Wideimage

          <p>
            There’s no point in joining an online casino if it doesn’t have the
            games you want to play. Fortunately, that shouldn’t be an issue at
            Ducky Luck. Here is an overview of the games we found during our
            Ducky Luck casino review.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Slot Machines and Progressive Jackpots"} />
          <p>
            The majority of the online casino at Ducky Luck is slot games. There
            are more than 400 slots available, including popular titles like
            Zombie FC, Tower of Fortuna, and Rise of the Titans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ducky Luck allows you to filter the slot games by the software
            provider that created them. That way, if you find one game you like,
            you can find other games by the same developer. Many developers have
            certain types of games they are known for.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, Betsoft slots are known for 3D graphics, while Saucify
            slots are known for more realistic animations. You can learn more
            about the various software providers by checking out this page.
          </p>
          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Online Casino Software Providers"} />
          </div>
          <p>
            You can also use game categories to help you find games you are
            interested in, like three-reel slots, video slots, or jackpot slots.
            For example, there are nearly 40 jackpot games available.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ducky Luck doesn’t have a specific policy for progressive jackpot
            winners. So, any jackpot winnings could be subject to the standard
            withdrawal limits. However, you may be able to get increased
            withdrawals by contacting customer service.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the things we looked at during our review of Ducky Luck was
            the terms and conditions. You should be aware that Ducky Luck
            reserves the right to use your first name and last initial in their
            list of recent winners.
          </p>
          <p>
            They also have a policy that states “big winners” could be asked to
            attend publicity events to celebrate their wins. The terms and
            conditions don’t specify exactly who counts as a big winner, so keep
            it in mind while you’re playing, especially if you play progressive
            jackpot games.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Blackjack, Roulette, and Other Table Games"} />
          <p>
            In addition to the vast collection of slots, Ducky Luck casino also
            has an adequate collection of table games. When you click the table
            games collection, you will notice that the majority of games are
            blackjack and roulette.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two options for American roulette and another game with
            European roulette. One of the American roulette games is from Rival
            Gaming, and the other is Dragon Gaming. So they are similar games,
            but they have different graphics and themes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blackjack players have four options to choose from, including two
            multi-hand games. There is also a rolling stack blackjack game. It
            is a standard blackjack game with a side bet that pays out when you
            get a suited ace/king, straight flush, a pair, or a straight. If you
            win the side bet, you can collect your winnings or add it to your
            standard blackjack wager to win more.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also play ride ‘em poker and card clash, which is a variant
            of casino war. But, unfortunately, that is the extent of the games
            in the table games category.
          </p>
          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              We were disappointed that we couldn’t find craps, sic bo, or any
              other dice games during our Ducky Luck online casino review.
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>
          <p>
            Several other card games were also lacking, such as digital baccarat
            and other casino poker variants.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Video Poker and Casual Games"} />
          <p>
            While the table games collection is adequate, there are certainly
            some options that are missing. On the other hand, the video poker
            collection is very impressive.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are fourteen video poker options. You can play deuces wild,
            aces and faces, deuces and joker, double joker, jacks or better,
            joker poker, or tens or better. The thing that makes Ducky Luck
            casino stand out is that they offer multi-hand versions of each
            video poker variant.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the video poker games, there is also a collection of
            casual games you can enjoy. The casual games collection includes
            seven bingo variants, two keno games, and three real money scratch
            cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also find teen patti and andar bahar games in the casual
            games section. We would generally classify those as table games, but
            Ducky Luck includes them with the specialty games instead.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Does Ducky Luck Have Live Casino Games?"} />
          <Wideimage
            src={
              "/image/reviews/ducky-luck-casino-review-live-casino-games-1.png"
            }
          />
          <p>
            Live dealer games are one of the most popular trends in the online
            casino industry. So, we were shocked to find several reviews of
            Ducky Luck that claimed the site does not offer live dealer casino
            games. However, those reviews are either outdated or simply wrong
            because Ducky Luck has an excellent live casino section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fresh Deck Studios is the provider that operates the live casino on
            Ducky Luck. You can play blackjack, roulette, and baccarat with a
            live dealer. Several dealers are usually available for each game,
            but the options vary. For example, you will find more options
            available during peak hours, while your late-night options might be
            limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each game has different betting limits when you play live dealer
            games on the online casino at Ducky Luck. For example, some
            blackjack games have limits as low as $10, while others have a
            minimum bet of $100 or more.
          </p>
          <p>
            We played several live games during our DuckyLuck.ag review, and we
            were impressed with the game quality. The live stream loaded quickly
            without lagging or glitches, and the dealers were friendly and
            interactive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, your experience may differ based on different dealers and
            other factors, but we are confident that most players will love
            playing live casino games on Ducky Luck casino.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Ducky Luck Casino Bonuses"} />
          <Wideimage
            src={"/image/reviews/ducky-luck-casino-review-bonuses-1.jpg"}
          />
          <p>
            Pretty much every online casino offers some kind of bonus,
            especially for new customers. If you have used other casino sites,
            you are probably familiar with deposit matches. Many sites offer to
            match your deposit between 150% or 200%, and then they pile on
            rollover requirements of 50-70x.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ducky Luck stands out because their welcome bonus offers a 500%
            deposit match up to $7,500. That means that you can deposit $100,
            and your starting bankroll will be $600! Or, you can deposit as
            little as $25, and you will still get $125 in bonus cash to play
            with.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we first saw that offer, we were expecting a massive rollover
            requirement. So, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that the
            wagering requirement is only 30x. It applies to both the deposit and
            the bonus funds, but 30x is really quite reasonable. Here are a few
            examples of different deposit amounts and how much the corresponding
            rollover would be.
          </p>
          {/*  {/ leave the table /} */}
          <p>
            This offer is already impressive, but on top of the 500% deposit
            match, you also receive 150 free spins! And if you use
            cryptocurrency to make your first deposit, you can get an even
            higher deposit match of 600%! Deposit matches that high are
            virtually unheard of, so you will want to take advantage of this
            offer as soon as possible!
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to this generous welcome bonus, Ducky Luck also has
            bonuses for existing customers. They have social media contests,
            referral bonuses, sweepstakes, free chips bonuses for specific
            games, and high-roller bonuses.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can earn additional rewards by climbing the ranks of the Ducky
            Luck VIP program. The Ducky Bucks Rewards program has four tiers,
            with various cashback, free spins, and additional rewards based on
            your tier.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to join the Ducky Bucks Reward program. You only need one
            point to join, and you earn points simply by depositing $20 or more.
            Every deposit you make will earn more points. Here is an overview of
            the rewards available at each tier.
          </p>

          {/*   {/ leave the table /} */}

          <p>
            The reload mega bonuses are reload bonus offers that you can redeem
            up to seven times per day! Your offer will be updated at the
            beginning of each month, based on your VIP level and how often you
            play. EasyWin bonuses are additional reload bonuses with lower
            deposit matches, lower wagering requirements, and unlimited
            redemptions.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also earn cashback bonuses and free spins. The free spins
            are triggered each time you make a deposit, and you can earn between
            25-100 free spins, depending on your deposit size.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            This VIP program is fantastic because anyone can participate. You
            earn points through every deposit, so it doesn’t matter if you want
            to play table games, bingo, or slots.
          </p>

          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              As long as you deposit cash, you can earn points and climb the
              ranks of the program.
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>
          <p>
            Ducky Luck Casino also has a Crypto Elite program. It is tied to the
            VIP program, but you can earn additional rewards, such as comp
            points, weekly contests, and prioritized payouts. Crypto Elite
            members also earn higher reload bonuses and cashback rewards.
          </p>
          <p>
            To join the Crypto Elite program, you simply need to contact
            customer service. However, once you become a Crypto Elite member,
            all non-crypto banking options will be removed from your cashier.
            You will only be able to deposit and withdraw using Bitcoin and
            other cryptocurrency banking methods.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            You get to choose whether you want to join the Crypto Elite program
            or simply stick to the Ducky Bucks Rewards program. Either way, you
            will get fantastic rewards from a straightforward VIP program. The
            program’s simplicity and the value of the rewards made this VIP
            program one of the highlights of our Ducky Luck review.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            At this point, you are probably convinced that Ducky Luck is an
            excellent casino. If you are dying to get started, there is one more
            thing you need to know. Before you can start playing casino games,
            you need to make a deposit to fund your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, Ducky Luck makes all of your transactions easy with
            several convenient banking methods. You can choose credit cards,
            cryptocurrency, or e-wallet banking methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it is crucial to know that some banking methods are
            unavailable in some locations. For example, wire transfers and paper
            checks are available for customers in the US, except for Maryland
            and Washington. Here is an overview of all the available banking
            methods and crucial facts about each of them, including the
            locations they are available in.
          </p>
          {/*  {/  leabe the table /} */}

          <p>
            There are plenty of banking options to choose from, especially when
            you make your deposits. The options are a little more limited for
            withdrawals. However, Ducky Luck is committed to approving
            withdrawals within 24 hours for all verified customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            It may take more time to get your payout delivered, but that depends
            on the banking method you choose. As long as you use Bitcoin, you
            can get your money in 48 hours or less!
          </p>

          {/*  {/ leave the tips /} */}
          <p>
            The Crypto Elite program makes it clear that Ducky Luck wants
            customers to choose Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to make all
            their deposits. In addition to the rewards offered through the VIP
            program, crypto users also have faster withdrawal times, no fees,
            and higher transaction limits! Anyone who wants to deposit more than
            $1,000 at a time will want to use crypto to make that process
            easier.{" "}

            There’s no need to be tied to your computer when Ducky Luck has a
            top-rated mobile casino option. The Ducky Luck app allows you to
            play your favorite casino games whenever and wherever you want.

            You don’t have to worry about downloading an app from the App Store
            or the Google Play store. Instead, you can visit the Ducky Luck
            mobile casino from the internet browser on your phone or tablet.
            Simply type Ducky Luck into the search bar and click on the Ducky

            The mobile site is almost exactly the same as the desktop website.
            There are a few minor visual differences because the site has to
            adapt to your screen size. But the navigation menus, games, and
            bonuses are all the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            We tested the mobile casino on an Android during our Ducky Luck
            casino review. The one thing we noticed is that the games took a
            couple of seconds longer to load when we were using the phone. But
            once the game loaded, it ran smoothly, and we didn’t have any other
            glitches.

            Ducky Luck’s mobile games also have settings that make it easy to
            adapt to playing on your phone. For example, the slot games have a
            left-hand mode that allows you to change which side of the screen
            the spin button is on. You can also turn your phone horizontally or
            vertically, and the game will adapt to your screen.

            Overall, we were very impressed with the Ducky Luck mobile casino.
            It is easy to use and convenient. Once you try it for yourself, you
            may find that you prefer the mobile gambling option because it
            offers the same top-quality casino with even more flexibility.

          <Title title={"More Information About Ducky Luck"} />
          <p>
            So far, our Ducky Luck review has covered pretty much everything the
            site offers. All that is left to cover is some background
            information about the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ducky Luck Casino is licensed by the Curacao e-Gaming Authority. The
            site must meet various standards to maintain its license, including
            offering fair games and performing regular audits. Curacao licenses
            allow the site to operate in most countries, but there are a few
            restrictions, which we will go over below.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Ducky Luck is affiliated with sportsandcasino.com, these sites
            are only connected through the Online Casino Share program. They are
            both affiliate sites through that program and use the same software
            developers, but that is where the connection ends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people wonder who owns Ducky Luck Casino. We found several
            reviews of Ducky Luck that claim Digital Adversary Company owns the
            website. Digital Adversary is a marketing company that may do some
            work for Ducky Luck, but the site itself is independently owned and
            operated. So, Ducky Luck Casino is owned and operated by the Ducky
            Luck company.
          </p>
          <p>
            We couldn’t find much information about the corporation. But we did
            find several awards and accolades from third parties, including
            several member’s choice awards. These awards affirm that Ducky Luck
            is a safe and trustworthy casino. You can see a list of recent
            awards in the site’s footer.

          <TextTitle title={"Customer Service on Ducky Luck"} />
          <p>
            Most customers will never need to contact customer service because
            Ducky Luck has created such a fantastic casino. However, you want a
            few convenient customer service options, just in case you have
            questions, or an issue comes up.
          </p>
          <p>
            The help section of the site is an excellent place to start,
            especially if you have common questions. You can search the help
            section for specific keywords or click on a specific category to
            find helpful articles.
          </p>

          <Cornerimage
            src={
              "/image/reviews/ducky-luck-casino-review-customer-service-1.png"
            }
          />
          <p>
            section doesn’t have what you need, you can contact customer
            service. There is a contact us button at the bottom of the page, or
            you can click “I need help with something else” at the bottom of the
            help section. You can also click the yellow chat icon at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, the chat support is an automated “virtual assistant.”
            You can ask simple questions about bonuses, withdrawals, and other
            basic information. It will point you in the right direction, but the
            virtual assistant cannot answer every question.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we tested it with questions about licensing and the terms and
            conditions, the virtual assistant just repeatedly responded with a
            message that it didn’t understand the question. If you stump the
            virtual assistant, you just get stuck.
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn’t give you an option to communicate with a live
            representative. You can keep trying different ways of asking your
            question, but if it doesn’t fall within a few categories, you will
            be out of luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only other option is to contact customer service via the website
            form. When you submit the form, the site will generate an email for
            you. Unfortunately, we had to wait about 24 hours to get a response
            to our email questions, so this isn’t a good option for urgent
            matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            This lack of live customer support is the biggest flaw we found
            during our review of Ducky Luck. We much prefer sites that offer
            live chat with a human representative. Telephone support would be
            another option that Ducky Luck could add to improve their customers’
            experience.

            If you have read our review of Ducky Luck casino this far, you know
            that there is a lot we love about this site. First, the site offers
            a fantastic collection of casino games, including nearly 40
            progressive jackpots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ducky Luck sweetens the deal by offering several bonuses and
            promotions. Their 500% welcome bonus up to $7,500 is particularly
            noteworthy because it offers an incredible match percentage and a
            high bonus cap with a reasonable wagering requirement. You can also
            earn VIP rewards every time you make a deposit! Of course, the
            convenient banking options and fantastic mobile casino are the icing
            on the cake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our only complaints about Ducky Luck Casino is that the customer
            service doesn’t allow you to connect with a human representative,
            and the site is missing a few table games. As long as those details
            aren’t dealbreakers for you, Ducky Luck is an excellent choice.
