          </p>
          <p>
            Launched in 2020, Las Atlantis Casino is still relatively new to the
            online casino world. While the site has come a long way in a short
            space of time, it’s still in uncharted waters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily for you, this Las Atlantis Casino review covers everything
            you need to know about the site.
          </p>
          <p>If you’re ready to take the plunge, let’s go!</p>

          <Title title={"About Las Atlantis Casino"} />
          <p>
            You’ll be pleased to learn that Las Atlantis hasn’t just been
            treading water since its inception in 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            The underwater Sin City has consistently added to its long list of
            games. It currently boasts a total of 250+ games, including slots,
            poker, blackjack, and even specialty games only available at Las
            Atlantis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from the wide range of games, the Las Atlantis Casino is easy
            – and fun – to navigate. As bubbles follow your cursor around the
            screen, you can access details about banking options, promotions,
            and customer support at the click of a button.
          </p>
          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              At first glance, LasAtlantis.com ticks all the boxes. The smooth
              and engaging user interface enables you to navigate the site
              effortlessly. The games look great and their bonuses are among the
              best in the business too.
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>
          <p>
            However, our review of the Las Atlantis Casino dives much deeper
            than this. Rather than simply scratching the surface, we examined
            every aspect of the site – leaving no stone unturned.
          </p>
          <p>
            What better place to start than with the games at Las Atlantis
            Casino?
          </p>
          <Title title={"Las Atlantis Casino Games"} />
          <p>
            Although Las Atlantis doesn’t offer as many games as some of the
            more mainstream online casinos out there, there are still stacks of
            games to keep you entertained.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 250+ game selection is provided by Realtime Gaming (RTG) and
            offers all the top real money slots, table games, and specialty
            titles. There is also a live dealer casino for you to take advantage
            of.
          </p>
          <p>
            LasAtlantis.com offers only casino games, though. There isn’t a
            sportsbook or dedicated poker room.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re okay with that, then let’s continue our LasAtlantis.com
            review by going over the games.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Online Slot Games"} />
          <div>
            <Cornerimage src={"/image/reviews/Los-Atlantis-Casino-slots.png"} />
            <p>
              There are now more than 200 slots to enjoy at the Las Atlantis
              Casino. In fact, slots make up roughly 80% of the game library on
              the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you would expect, all the classic slots are there. Achilles,
              Ancient Gods, Panda Magic, Secret Jungle, and Stardust are among
              the most popular options. Unique games, like Banana Jones and Fish
              Catch, are featured in the “Specialties” section.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the slots are fun and easy to play, so make sure you scroll
              through the entire library and find your favorites.
            </p>
          </div>

          <TextTitle title={"Casino Table Games"} />
          <div>
            <Cornerimage
              src={"/image/reviews/Las-Atlantis-Casino-table-games.png"}
            />
            <p>
              Las Atlantis doesn’t have a huge range of table games, but there
              are more than enough options to satisfy lovers of poker and card
              games.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the “Table” tab on the site, you will find mainstream
              options such as craps, red dog, Vegas three card rummy, and war.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also found an extensive blackjack section during our Las
              Atlantis online casino review. You’ll find eight different
              blackjack variations under the dedicated blackjack tab, including
              21 face up, pontoon, and super 21.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given that RTG tables are generally one-seat games, you can’t play
              more than one hand at any given time. However, you can play more
              hands since only you’re playing and the RNG deals faster than a
              human dealer.
            </p>
            <p>
              These games are simple to play too, which means beginner casino
              gamblers will feel at home here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, the Las Atlantis casino table game selection gets two
              thumbs up from us. We cover them in even more detail in the
              following blog post.

          <TextTitle title={"Video Poker Games"} />
          <p>
            With slots taking center stage at LasAtlantis.com, poker takes a
            backseat. There are 17 different poker games to choose from.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sure, there is nothing new or exciting about these options, but
            there are at least several variations to choose from. You wont get
            bored playing video poker at Las Atlantis.

              Click on the “Specialties” tab and you’ll find 11 featured games.
              That may not sound like many, but they all offer something a bit
              different.

            This is a nice mixture of non-standard casino games. We enjoyed
            playing them, as well as the other games, during our Las Atlantis
            Casino review.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Mobile Gaming Options at LasAtlantis.com"} />

          <p>Want to take Las Atlantis with you wherever you go? No problem!</p>
          <p>
            Not only can you enjoy the underwater casino on your desktop, but
            you can also play your favorite games on dry land by using the Las
            Atlantis mobile casino.
          </p>
          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              There isn’t an official Las Atlantis Casino app. However, the
              mobile casino at Las Atlantis offers a seamless uncompromising
              experience on your smartphone and table. The seamless switch from
              desktop to mobile even makes it feel like you’re using an app!
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>
          <p>
            Whether you’re an iOS or Android user, the Las Atlantis Casino is
            equally responsive – ensuring you never miss out on opportunities to
            win money.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Banking at Las Atlantis Casino"} />
          <p>
            The next step of our Las Atlantis review takes us to the site’s
            banking options. Needless to say, this is an important area for
            every online casino. It’s vital that we examine it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this section, we cover everything you need to know about making
            deposits, withdrawals, payment options, limits, and payout times.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Deposit Options"} />

          <p>
            The first thing to note is that Las Atlantis offers a wide range of
            payment options. From credit and debit cards to cryptocurrencies,
            you won’t struggle to add funds to your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deposits will hit your account instantly. The exception is
            cryptocurrency, which can take 1-15 minutes to process.
          </p>
          {/* 
        {/ leave the table /} */}
          <p>
            Until recently, Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency Las Atlantis
            accepted. But if have a variety of crypto, you’ll be pleased to
            learn that Las Atlantis now accepts Ethereum too.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the deposit limits, there is nothing out of the ordinary. You
            can deposit up to $1,000 using Visa or Mastercard, while there is no
            limit on crypto deposits.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Las Atlantis Casino Withdrawal Options"} />
          <p>
            While some online casinos charge you to withdraw funds, there is no
            withdrawal fee at Las Atlantis. Regardless of how you choose to move
            your money, you won’t be charged for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            While reviewing the Las Atlantis Casino, we also found the site
            allows for card payouts. This isn’t something every online casino
            offers.
          </p>

          {/*     {/ leave th table /} */}

          <p>
            All in all, Las Atlantis’ banking options are great. However, there
            is one downside – the $150 minimum payout. Even with Bitcoin, you
            need at least $150 to withdraw funds from your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is frustrating because the minimum deposit limits are $10-$30.
            This means that any deposit you make between $10-$149 is stuck on
            Las Atlantis until you win enough to cross the $150 threshold.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s also worth noting that the payout times aren’t too fast,
            either. You should receive a Bitcoin payout in 1-3 business days,
            but Visa and Mastercard customers can expect to wait 3-4 business
            days for their winnings. If you opt for a bank wire, you will be
            waiting for up to five business days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having said all that, the payment options at Las Atlantis are one of
            the site’s strong points.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Las Atlantis Casino Promotions"} />
          <p>
            As soon as you access LasAtlantis.com, you will be greeted with a
            juicy 280% welcome offer in the middle of the home page. Even if you
            are new to the world of online casinos, you won’t need us to tell
            you that this promotion is hugely generous.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the initial Las Atlantis welcome bonus is merely a drop in the
            ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Across the three bonus categories on the site – Welcome Bonuses, New
            Game, and Special Bonuses – you will find tons of attractive
            promotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only is there a wide range of welcome bonuses to take advantage
            of, but there are also plenty of ongoing promotions on offer. The
            deposit match bonuses are tasty, and you can find lots of free
            spins, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we carried out our Las Atlantis Casino review, we found the
            following promotions.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Las Atlantis Welcome Bonuses"} />
          <p>
            In total, there are six welcome bonuses on offer at LasAtlantis.com
            – five of which offer a 250%+ deposit match. Many of them also have
            free spins attached, giving you more chances to win cash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s take a closer look at the Las Atlantis Casino welcome bonuses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Make sure you pay attention to Las Atlantis’ bonus terms. Some of
            these offers are available only on your first deposit, while others
            are available for up to your first five deposits.
          </p>
          <p>
            This will impact the offer you ultimately decide to claim –
            especially since claiming one offer will often make you ineligible
            to claim any other bonuses for new customers at LasAtlantis.com.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ll look at some offers for existing customers in just a moment.

          <TextTitle title={"New Game Promotions"} />
          <p>
            At the time of our review of Las Atlantis Casino, there was only one
            “New Game” promotion. Still, we recommend checking the site
            regularly to keep up to date with all the latest offers for new
            games.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the new game offer we found during our Las Atlantis casino
            review.
          </p>

          <div className="blue">
            <h2>Bubble Bubble 3</h2>
            <p>
              Bubble Bubble 3 is a fun witch-themed online slot from RealTime
              Gaming. This slot reminds you of Halloween with its cauldron,
              spell book, witch’s hat, and pumpkin symbols. You can win up to
              4000x your stake if you hit the right combination.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game is fun enough on its own, but the free spins offer from
              Las Atlantis Casino takes it to another level. Here are the
              details.

          <TextTitle title={"Special Bonuses at Las Atlantis"} />
          <p>
            The following table shows some of the special bonuses at
            LasAtlantis.com. All you need to do is use the bonus code on the
            deposit screen to claim the offer.
          </p>
          {/*   {/ leave the tabel /} */}

          <p>
            Keep in mind that the match percentage you receive will depend on
            how much you deposit. The more you deposit, the more bonus money Las
            Atlantis will give you for every $1 you deposit.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are not the only deals we spotted during our Las Atlantis
            review. There were many more, including limited-time deals. If you
            decide to play there, we recommend you keep an eye on your player
            account and email inbox as they will frequently send you new offers
            to take advantage of.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Reviewing Las Atlantis’ Customer Service"} />
          <p>
            It’s inevitable – we all run into issues when using online casinos.
            When you run into an issue at Las Atlantis Casino, you can get it
            taken care of easily by reaching out to their customer support team.
          </p>
          <p>Here are all the ways you can contact them.</p>
          <div className="pink">

              desc={": Select “Chat” from the dropdown menu"}
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            It can often be difficult to quickly find contact information for
            online casinos. Many sites prioritize other aspects over customer
            support, making it tricky to contact the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to Las Atlantis, however, you can not fault the
            customer service.
          </p>
          <p>
            The “Contact Us” tab on the homepage dropdown menu takes you
            straight to the assistance email address. You will also find
            telephone numbers for two countries – for those online gambling in
            Australia and the US – on that page, which is quite rare.
          </p>

          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              There is a separate “Chat” tab on the homepage dropdown menu, too.
              If you want a speedy response, we highly recommend using the
              site’s live chat function.
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>

          <p>
            Having tested the live chat multiple times, we can safely say that
            the Las Atlantis staff are extremely responsive. After entering a
            username, we didn’t have to wait more than 30 seconds to speak to a
            member of staff on every occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            While many online casinos force you to go through tons of automated
            questions before reaching a human, LasAtlantis.com aims to get to
            the bottom of your enquiry as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            As far as online casino customer service goes, Las Atlantis is up
            there with the best.
          </p>

          <Title title={"What’s Missing from LasAtlantis.com?"} />
          <p>
            If you have read our Las Atlantis review from the very beginning,
            you’ll know that we haven’t had a bad word to say about the site or
            the company – until now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don’t get us wrong, Las Atlantis is a legit online casino. But in
            order to carry out a thorough and fair review of LasAtlantis.com, we
            need to talk about where the site can improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first glance, the site looks smooth and modern. When you sign up
            and log in, however, the site appears far more dated behind the
            scenes.
          </p>

          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              While they have taken the time to ensure the home page looks
              great, the site does become a bit archaic when you take the plunge
              and dive deeper into the Las Atlantis backend.
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>

          <p>
            Although there is a wide range of games, there isn’t a vast
            selection of game providers. Realtime Gaming provides most of the
            games, with a little help from Visionary iGaming.
          </p>
          <p>
            This may not bother everyone. But because many of the top online
            casinos use multiple game providers, it’s worth pointing out.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also worth noting that Las Atlantis does not accept real money
            wagers from the residents of the follow countries.

            Although it isn’t uncommon for online casinos to have location
            restrictions, we hope that some of the above nations get the chance
            to experience the underwater treasure of Las Atlantis in the
            not-too-distant future.
