    <Header>Super Slots Review for 2022</Header>
    <Section>
      <Container>
        <p>Why should you bother to read this Super Slots casino review? For starters, it consistently makes appearances on our top-lists of best online casinos available. And there’s a reason for that.</p>
        <p>For example, they have an extensive collection of slot games as their name suggests. That’s not all, though – you can find a nice assortment of blackjack, video poker, and casino table games, too.</p>
        <p>But an impressive collection of games isn’t enough to make our list of top sites. There are plenty of other reasons we wholeheartedly recommend Super Slots, ranging from their games to their bonuses and banking methods.

</p>
        <p>You can click the button below to head to SuperSlots.ag to see for yourself why they’re such an awesome casino. Or read our review below to learn all the reasons why our Super Slots ratings are always so high.

</p>
      {/*   {/ leave  /} */}

        <Title title={"About SuperSlots Casino"}/>
        <p>Two of the most common questions we get about this (or any) online casino are, “is Super Slots safe,” and “is it legal?” As far as legality goes, we're not lawyers, so we're unqualified to answer that question. We recommend you speak to a lawyer or an expert on the gambling laws in your area.</p>
        <p>As far as it being a safe online casino, Super Slots is safe, no doubt about it. But if you don’t want to take our word for it, here is a little more information we found during our SuperSlots review.</p>
        <TextTitle title={"Is Super Slots Safe?"}/>
        <p>When we first learned about Super Slots, they were a brand new casino. The site officially launched in 2020. We don’t usually recommend new sites because we prefer to wait until they have an established reputation with the online gambling community.</p>
        <p>However, we changed our minds about SuperSlots Casino when we figured out who operates the site. It’s the same company that owns BetOnline.ag and SportsBetting.ag, sites that have been operating since the mid-1990s. So, the parent company has been around since the early days of online gambling, which made us far more willing to trust Super Slots.</p>

        <Borderedbox>
          <p>We also searched dozens of Super Slots reviews and couldn’t find any complaints or unresolved customer concerns. More importantly, the site has developed a reputation for paying its customer quickly and offering fair casino games.</p>
        </Borderedbox>

        <p>So, we were reasonably sure that Super Slots was safe a few years ago when the site first launched. Now that it has been operating for several years, we’re even more confident that SuperSlots is a safe online casino.</p>
        <TextTitle title={"Is Super Slots Legal?"}/>
        <p>SuperSlots.ag doesn’t make it clear in their terms and conditions who can or cannot play here. We emailed them to ask about it and never heard back from them. So, we checked their FAQ page during our review and came across a question about whether it’s legal to gamble SuperSlots.ag. Here is their answer:</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p>“It is legal to bet in our casino, depending on your location. Our Super Slots Casino is located in Panama and wagering is permitted there. It's the player's responsibility to check with local government rules and regulations to ensure they're abiding by the rules.”</p>
        </Borderedbox>

        <p>Our understanding is that they accept players from all countries. It’s up to you to determine whether you can play at Super Slots legally. If you are in the United States, you can legally use the online casino at Super Slots because there are no federal laws that prohibit online gambling.</p>
        <p>Our gambling jurisdictions page is a good resource for anyone who might be wondering about the online gambling laws in specific states or other countries.</p>

        <Title title={"Super Slots Casino Review"}/>
        <p>SuperSlots.ag has a robust library of more than 200 digital and live dealer casino games. Their games come from developers like BetSoft, Nucleus Gaming, Rival Gaming, Visionary iGaming, and more.

</p>
        <p>We checked out lots of the games during our Super Slots Casino review and we were impressed with the variety of table games, video poker and slot machines, and live casino games. What we want to do now is show you some of the games you can play at Super Slots and share what we liked most and least about their game selection.</p>
        <TextTitle title={"Table Games"}/>
        <Squareimage src={"/image/reviews/super-slots-table-games.jpg"}/>
        <p>We found more than 35 table games during our SuperSlots.ag Casino review. Here are the games that stood out to us.

</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Zoom Roulette"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"American Blackjack"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Pontoon"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Multi-hand Blackjack"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Caribbean Poker"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Triple Edge Poker"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Baccarat"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Three Card Rummy"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"European Roulette"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Craps"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Red Dog"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Pirate 21"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Pai Gow Poker"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Oasis Poker"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={"Casino War"} desc={"Casino War"}/>
        </div>
        <p>This isn’t the entire list. There are a few duplicate titles, which is to be expected because of all the software developers they work with. We like the duplicate titles because it allows you to choose the game you like most based on its rules, payouts, graphics, and more.

</p>
        <p>Another notable thing are their table game stakes. They offer a much wider range of betting limits compared to other US casinos. For example, one of their blackjack games lets you bet between $1-$5,000, and one of the roulette games lets you bet between $1-$10,000.</p>
        <p>As far as complaints go, we don’t have any. The table game selection is solid. We enjoyed playing them during our review of SuperSlots.ag, and we think you will too.</p>

        <TextTitle title={"Video Poker"}/>
        <Squareimage src={"/image/reviews/super-slots-video-poker-machines.jpg"}/>

        <p>We found 13 video poker games during our Super Slots review.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Jacks or Better"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Joker Poker"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Bonus Deuces"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"All American"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Deuces and Joker Poker"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Double Joker Poker"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Split Way Royale"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Bonus Poker"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Tens or Better"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Five Draw Poker"}/>
        </div>
        <p>Like the table games, there are a few duplicate video poker titles. There are also a couple of variations. One variant is a multi-hand video poker game that lets you play more than one hand per round. They also have Pyramid Poker games.

</p>
        <p>The stakes you can play for depends on the game and variant. The machines we checked allow you to play for $1 to $100. This is reasonable compared to video poker games on other online casinos.</p>
        <p>The games we played look great too, which is saying something for a video poker machine. These look more modern than some machines, like the ones from IGT that you find in most brick-and-mortar casinos.

</p>
        <p>Overall, this is a solid library of video poker games. If you like to play video poker, we think you’ll be happy at SuperSlots.ag.</p>

        <TextTitle title={"Slots"}/>
        <Squareimage src={"/image/reviews/super-slots-slot-machines.jpg"}/>

        <p>We counted more than 130 slot machines during our SuperSlots.ag review. There’s no way we can list them all here. However, we do want to share a few of our favorite real money slots that you can play here.</p>
        <div>

          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Miles Bellhouse and the Gears of Time"}/>
        </div>
        <p>Most of the slots come from BetSoft. BetSoft is known for creating 3D slots. These are a blast to play because they remind us of video games. We love the story their cutscenes tell, the vibrant graphics and characters, and fun bonus rounds.</p>
        <p>We’ve spent more time “testing” these slots during our review of Super Slots than we care to admit. If you’re not sure which slots to play first, then the list above is a good place to start. We also recommend A Night in Paris, The Genius, and Invaders!</p>
        <p>When we first wrote this Super Slots Casino review, we mentioned that we couldn’t find all of Betsoft’s slots here. For example, we didn’t see slots like The Slot Father, Frankenslot’s Monster, or Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.

</p>
        <p>It looks like this is still an issue. We did manage to find Frankenslot’s Monster, but not the other two. This is only going to be a problem if there are specific slots from Betsoft you want to play. Otherwise, you won’t have any issues finding a slot at SuperSlots Casino.</p>

        <TextTitle title={"Live Dealer Games"}/>
        <Squareimage src={"/image/reviews/super-slots-live-dealer-casino.jpg"}/>

        <p>The last section we want to cover in our review of Super Slots is their live dealer casino. They have two of them – the Black Casino from Fresh Deck Studios and Red Casino from Visionary iGaming (ViG). Both casinos carry most of the same games. However, each casino also carries a couple of exclusive live dealer games.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"American Roulette (both)"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"European Roulette (both)"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Baccarat (both)"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Blackjack Early Payout (Red)"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Blackjack HD Exclusive (Red)"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Auto European Roulette (Red)"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Auto American Roulette (Red)"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"Super6 (Red)"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"BJ Baltic (Black)"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"BJ VIP (Black)"}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={""} desc={"BJ Russian (Black)"}/>
        </div>
        <p>The stakes you can play for depend on the game. Most of the card games start at $5 and peak at between $2,500 and $10,000. The roulette games have limits of between $0.50 and $12,500.</p>

      {/*   {/ leave the tips /} */}
        <p>We also found a few digital games in both live casinos too. These games come from Platipus Gaming and Rival Gaming. We think this is an awesome (and somewhat hidden) surprise because it increases the number of games you can play and gives you some high-quality alternatives to the main casino.</p>
        <p>And that wraps up the game portion of our SuperSlots.ag review. The bottom line is this – the online casino at Super Slots is top-notch. Their name is a little misleading, though. Sure, they have plenty of high-quality slots, but you’ll find loads of excellent table games, video poker machines, and live casino games too.</p>

        <Title title={"Reviewing Super Slots Banking Options"}/>
        <p>Super Slots has an extensive collection of banking methods, including standard options like credit cards and cryptocurrency. But Super Slots doesn’t stop there. They go above and beyond by also accepting money orders, bank checks, wire transfers, and Person 2 Person.</p>

        <Borderedbox>
          <p>While those additional banking options are convenient in some circumstances, you won’t want to use them all the time. They often have absurdly low withdrawal limits and annoying fees.
</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>The best way to get your money to and from Super Slots is cryptocurrency. We found seven different crypto options during our Super Slots casino review, and they seem to add new options regularly.</p>

        <TextTitle title={"Deposits"}/>
        <p>Here are the deposit methods you can use at SuperSlots.ag and the minimum and maximum deposit limits.

</p>
       {/*  {/ leave the table /} */}

        <p>There is a significant disparity between the deposit limits for cryptocurrency and other banking methods. If you use crypto, you can deposit up to $100,000 or more. Some of the non-crypto banking methods have deposit limits that are less than $1,000. You might be able to have the deposit limits raised, but only if you contact customer service and send them documentation to verify your account.</p>
        <p>No matter which deposit method you choose, SuperSlots.ag will process the deposit as soon as they receive it. However, if you choose to send a bank check or money order, it may take 2-4 business days to get delivered.

</p>

        <TextTitle title={"Super Slots Payment Methods"}/>
        <p>Here are all of Super Slots payment methods and the minimum and maximum cash-out limits.</p>
{/*         {/ leave the table /} */}

        <p>If you want to get a check by courier, you'll have to pay a fee that varies, and it could take seven to fifteen business days to get your money. Some US banks will not cash checks from Super Slots, so make sure you can cash the check before you choose that withdrawal method.</p>
        <p>Cryptocurrency is the easiest way to withdraw money from Super Slots. All crypto withdrawals are free, and they typically get to your account within 48 hours. If you would like more information on using crypto for online gambling, check out our crypto guide.</p>

        <Title title={"Review of Super Slots Bonuses and Promotions"}/>
        <Wideimage src={"/image/reviews/Super-Slots-review-bonuses.jpg"}/>
        <p>Super Slots is known as one of the top US casino sites because it offers a fantastic welcome bonus worth up to $6,000. But the excitement doesn’t stop there. Existing customers can also take advantage of several other online casino bonus offers. We'll cover everything you need to know about them in this portion of our Super Slots online casino review.</p>

        <TextTitle title={"Super Slots Welcome Bonus"}/>
        <p>The welcome bonus on Super Slots is unique because it spreads the bonus out across your first six deposits. That structure allows you to get the maximum amount of bonus cash without needing to deposit your entire bankroll at once.</p>
        <p>It’s still a good idea to deposit as much as you are comfortable on the first deposit because the match percentage is higher. You can get a 250% match on your first deposit. After that, the match percentage is only 100%. The maximum bonus amount you can get for each bonus is $1,000.</p>
        <p>Make sure to use the bonus code SS250 when you make your first deposit. Then, during the subsequent five deposits, the bonus code is SS100.</p>
        <p>There is a 35x rollover requirement that applies to both the deposit and the bonus. You only have 30 days to meet that rollover before your bonus funds expire. Here are a few examples of the rollover requirements for various deposit amounts.</p>

     {/*    {/ leave the table /} */}
        <p>If you want to get the maximum bonus amount, you would need to deposit a total of $5,400 across your first six deposits. The total rollover requirement would be $399,000.</p>
        <p>Remember that you do not have to deposit the full amount to get the maximum bonus. If you don’t think you will be able to meet the rollover requirement, deposit a smaller amount. </p>

        <TextTitle title={"Reload Bonuses on Super Slots"}/>
        <p>Super Slots has three additional deposit bonuses that you can use once you are an established customer. However, these promos are only available on certain days of the week.</p>

        <div className='green'>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"VIP Reload "} desc={"– Deposit on a Sunday to get a 50% match of up to $500 with the code SSVIP50. This bonus has a 20x rollover and must be used within seven days."}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Tuesday Top Up"} desc={"– When you deposit $50 or more on a Tuesday, you can get $50 bonus cash with the code SSTOPUP. You can collect this bonus up to three times every week, as long as you meet the 45x rollover requirement between deposits."}/>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Hump Day Special "} desc={" – You can earn a 25% or 50% deposit match when you deposit on Wednesdays. The match percentage depends on the size of your deposit, and you will need to use a different bonus code for each one."}/>
        </div>

        <p>These reload bonuses are a valuable addition for existing customers. The rollover requirements for these bonuses vary, but they are significantly smaller than the welcome bonus rollovers.</p>
        <p>Make sure you read the terms and conditions for each bonus you want to collect. That is important because there are different rules for each one, including which games you can use the bonus funds on.</p>

        <TextTitle title={"Crypto Bonuses at SuperSlots.ag Casino"}/>
        <p>Cryptocurrency deposits are the fastest and most convenient way to deposit on Super Slots. It’s also the only deposit method that lets you qualify for additional bonuses. We found two cryptocurrency bonuses during our review of Super Slots casino.</p>
        <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"You can use the code CRYPTO400 to get a massive 400% bonus when you make your first crypto deposit. For example, if you deposit $100, you will have a bankroll of $500 available immediately!"}/>
        <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"The other crypto bonus is only available when you use Bitcoin to deposit. It boosts your deposit by 5%, and there is no maximum bonus amount with this offer. You don’t need a bonus code to activate this offer. Instead, just click the boost toggle button on the deposit screen."}/>
        <p>The best part is that you can use the Bitcoin boost and the crypto bonus at the same time. These crypto bonuses are surprisingly generous, especially if you were already planning to use Bitcoin for your deposit.</p>
        <p>In addition to these bonuses, Super Slots also has a game of the week program, a 10% weekly rebate, a referral bonus, and seasonal offers. Check out our Super Slots bonus page for more information.</p>

        <div className='flex flex-wrap justify-center'>
          <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Super Slots Bonuses"}/>
        </div>

        <Title title={"Is There a Super Slots App?"}/>
        <Squareimage src={"/image/reviews/Super-Slots-review-mobile.png"}/>
        <p>No, there isn’t a native Super Slots mobile app. There is nothing to download to play their games on your smartphone or table. Super Slots has a mobile-responsive website instead. We prefer mobile responsive websites because they’re compatible with more devices, such as those running on iOS, Android, BlackBerry, and Windows</p>
        <p>All you need to do to access Super Slots on mobile is open your mobile web browser (like Safari or Google Chrome), input SuperSlots.ag in the address bar, and then the casino will handle the rest.</p>
        <p>We tested the mobile site during our Super Slots review. It’s nearly identical to the desktop casino. But we did notice one small difference – there are fewer video poker games. There may be fewer games in other categories too, but they have too many games overall to know for sure.

</p>
        <p>Overall, Super Slots has done a good job here. We’d like to see more video poker games and maybe a slightly better mobile navigation in the Red Live Casino. There seemed to be a bug whenever we got to the bottom of their live casino games.</p>
        <p>That’s all the major stuff we noticed. However, if you want to know more about the Super Slots app and all its pros and cons, then click on the button below to read our review.</p>

        <div className='flex flex-wrap justify-center'>
          <Bluebutton link={""} title={"SuperSlots.ag App Review"}/>
        </div>

        <Title title={"Customer Support"}/>
        <p>SuperSlots.ag is available 24/7/365. You can contact them using these channels.</p>
        <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Email – cssupport@superslots.ag"}/>
        <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Live chat"}/>
        <p>As part of our SuperSlots casino review, we contacted the site by live chat to ask them whether they offered a demo mode for their games. Unfortunately, they said no.</p>
        <p>The good news is that we didn’t have to wait long for someone to help us via live chat. Our question was answered quickly and courteously, too. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the same experience when we emailed them – because no one responded.</p>
        <p>Other than improving that aspect of their customer support, we’d like to see them add phone support in the future. We mentioned this in a previous review of SuperSlots.ag, but they have yet to add it. Our fingers are crossed that they add phone support before we review them again.

</p>

        <Title title={"Wrapping Up Our Super Slots Review"}/>
