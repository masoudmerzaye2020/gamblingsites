          <p>
            The wilderness can often be a place of wonder — a great, uncharted
            landscape packed with jewels and mystical rewards abound. At other
            times, it’s better left alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our expert Wild Casino review aims to figure out which camp
            WildCasino.ag fits in. Are they a place of wonder or should you
            leave them alone?
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re going to answer those questions by showing you what’s behind
            the gripping interface and awesome graphics. You’ll learn about the
            games you can play for real money, bonuses you can claim to boost
            your bankroll, and the payout options you can use to cash-out your
            winnings – and so much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The law of the jungle suggests that only the smartest and bravest
            get the lion’s share. Let’s find out if those same principles apply
            when hunting for prizes at WildCasino.ag.

          <Title title={"Wild Casino Bonuses and Promotions"} />
          <p>
            Are you skeptical of offers that shine like gold from afar, but fade
            to dust as soon as you claim them? Looks like we have something in
            common. That’s why we wanted to start this Wild Casino review by
            looking at their bonuses and promotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a sneak peek at what the site is currently awarding to new
            and existing players.
          </p>

          </div>

          <p>
            The bonuses at WildCasino.ag really compliment the loose and
            exciting feel of the site. We love seeing all the seasonal offers
            and ongoing customer promotions. It’s those offers that will make
            you want to come back time and time again.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, your first experience with a Wild Casino bonus will likely
            be their massive welcome offer. So, let’s look at that now so that
            you know what to expect (and get excited for!).
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"$5,000 Welcome Bonus"} />
          <p>Here are the details for the Wild Casino welcome bonus.</p>

              }
            />
          </div>
          <p>In total, you can collect as much as $5,000. Pretty good, huh?</p>
          <p>
            Well, like anything wild or feral, it’s best to approach with
            caution. In other words, there are terms and conditions to be aware
            of before you try to run your fingers over the lion’s mane.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news is that the playthrough requirement for the Wild
            Casino welcome bonus is reasonable – only 35x your deposit and
            bonus. Compared to the 40x-50x playthrough you’ll find at most other
            online casinos, this is pretty darn good.
          </p>

          {/*  {/ top tiop /} */}

          <p>
            Overall, the $5,000 welcome bonus is impressive. You don’t see many
            online casinos offering that much bonus money to new customers,
            which is why it stood out during our WildCasino.ag review.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s only one of the promotions Wild Casino is running too. Once
            you’re done with the welcome bonus, you can move onto one of their
            deals for existing customers. We cover those promotions in more
            detail on the following page.
          </p>

          <p>
            To find out how good Wild Casino really is, our team donned their
            backpacks and hit the neon jungles. We stopped off first at the most
            obvious destination to find out if the top slots at Wild Casino were
            as good as we heard.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            First things first — slots are king on this site. We all agreed
            that’s what it felt like, at least, and had some fun testing out our
            theory.

          <p>
            After that, we headed for the tables to try a few spins on some
            interesting roulette variants. The good news is that you will find
            top American and European roulette at WildCasino.ag, with some more
            obscure titles that make for an easy way to waste some time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blackjack? They have it covered. The same goes for baccarat, which
            is always good to see represented in all its glory. Overall, we’re
            pleased with the game selection here. What we want to do now is show
            you some of the best games we tested during our Wild Casino review.
          </p>

          <p>
            Slots lovers will be truly in their element at WildCasino.ag.
            Alongside 5-reels, 3-reels, videos, and jackpot titles, the top
            slots at Wild Casino are up there with the best you’ll find today.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            We were particularly impressed with the variety available, with
            almost 230 slots games ready to sample. From old-school classics to
            fresh and innovative creations, there’s a lot to love here. Here are
            a few of the slots that stood out to us during our review.

            By all means, there is room for improvement. But with an array of
            high RTP slots, great bonus features and free games, and mobile
            friendly-titles, they are clearly doing a great job.

          <p>
            We know some players are crazy about this casino classic, which is
            why we made it a point to check out the blackjack games at Wild
            Casino.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            You will find the usual types of games under this category. For
            example, American and Single Deck Blackjack are here. There are also
            a few uncommon options in case you’re up for trying something new.

          <p>
            Overall, we’re confident that blackjack fans will find plenty of
            options here – and that’s not even including the live dealer
            blackjack games, which we’ll get to in a minute.

            Alongside blackjack, you will find the usual casino classics at this
            site. Roulette? Well, that’s a given. Baccarat? Yup. More so, you
            will also find a sweet mix of other table games and variants that
            might not be on your radar (yet).
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are the table games we spotted during our review of
            WildCasino.ag.

          <p>
            Keep in mind that there are duplicates of several of these games.
            This is a good thing because it gives you the opportunity to choose
            a game based on the graphics you like most or its rules and payouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            One other thing – some of these games are also available with a real
            human dealer inside the live casino. But more on that in just a
            second.

            A pretty nice mix, by our findings, which is also how we’d sum up
            our entire gaming experience while using the online casino at
            WildCasino.ag.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, there is no sportsbook at Wild Casino. When we spoke
            to one of the customer support reps, they couldn’t tell us if there
            was a plan to introduce such a feature to the site. That’s okay,
            though. This allows Wild Casino to focus on one thing – their online
            casino – and make it as good as they can.
          </p>
          <p>
            We think they’re doing a good job so far, and we’re excited to do
            more reviews of Wild Casino in the future to see what else they may
            add or improve on. If you’re interested in hearing about what we
            find, then consider checking out and bookmarking the following blog

          <p>
            When it comes to the WildCasino.ag live dealer games library, we
            have to put a big green tick next to it. There are some impressive
            titles here that are separated into two individual lobbies – Black
            and Red.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Black live casino contains a great selection of titles that are
            powered by Fresh Deck Studios. Among the tables on offer are
            roulette, poker, blackjack, and baccarat. We found the live dealers
            to be upbeat and vibrant, with the overall atmosphere what you would
            expect from a high-end casino.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Red section has a smaller number of games that are accessible
            24/7/365. That is, excluding when the site is down for maintenance.
          </p>

            <p>
              Although such a scenario can be frustrating, we were keen to point
              out that a site taking time to improve its service gets an
              additional point in our review of Wild Casino. Who doesn’t want to
              see any casino looking to offer a better product?
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>
          <p>Finding the games was easy. Playing them was even easier. </p>
          <p>
            With that being said, we weren’t overly impressed by the layout of
            the live dealer casino games at Wild Casino, which probably could
            have been arranged a little better. Again, WE found them without
            much of a headache. But players lacking our experience might not be
            able to do the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s just one of the negatives we found. Here are all the
            positives and negatives we spotted during our review of the Wild
            Casino live casino.

          <Title title={"Review of the Wild Casino App and Mobile Site"} />
          <p>
            You might be looking to play mobile games at Wild Casino on your
            iPhone. Someone else will probably be hoping that there is a native
            Wild Casino mobile app for Android. The bottom line is that you
            can’t please all the people, all the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, anyone playing slots or live dealer games on any smartphone
            or tablet should demand a good service if they’re playing at an
            online casino for real money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is there a native Wild Casino app? The answer is no, but the mobile
            site works just as well as playing the casino on desktop. In fact,
            we were thinking of providing a breakdown of how the mobile site
            compared to playing via PC, but there was really no point.
          </p>

          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              We found nothing tangibly different when playing their casino
              games on iPhone, Android, and other mobile operating systems
              compared to playing their games on our PCs and laptops.

          />
          <p>
            Having fared exceptionally well to this point, we were keen to see
            how easy it is to make a deposit at WildCasino.ag.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing we looked at was the number of deposit methods,
            which left us with no real cause for concern. Using credit cards to
            gambling online isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, so we look for variety
            before we worry too much about limits or speed.
          </p>

            <b>Our verdict? Wild Casino passes with flying colors.</b>
          </p>

          {/* {/ leave tabele /} */}

          <p>
            As you can see, there are plenty of options when it comes to
            depositing. The site takes extra precautions to ensure that you are
            secure when transferring money, too. So, if you are asking if
            depositing is safe at Wild Casino, the answer is yes.
          </p>

          {/* {/ leave the tip /} */}

          <TextTitle title={"Wild Casino Payout Review        "} />
          <p>
            What about payouts at Wild Casino? The good news is that you’ll have
            plenty of options.
          </p>

          {/* {/ table   /} */}

          <p>
            However, some of their withdrawal options have fees, which is a
            bummer. That definitely impacts the overall rating in our
            WildCasino.ag review. That said, you shouldn’t have any issues
            cashing out your winnings. And to be completely fair, it is only the
            less frequented withdrawal methods that are subject to fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those fees are also a minor complaint when you consider the
            withdrawal limits, which aren’t exactly terrible. In fact, we would
            say they are on the upper end of what you can expect from most
            top-rated US online casinos these days.
          </p>

          <Title
            title={"Wild Casino Review Verdict: More Safari than Jungle?"}
          />
          <p>
            Is Wild Casino …wild? We wouldn’t exactly say so. On the contrary,
            our overall impression of this site is that it’s pretty refined and
            in good order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not everything was to our liking, of course. Fees on certain
            withdrawals, for example, aren’t exactly inspiring. Perhaps a few
            more software providers could make a difference too.
          </p>

          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              With that being said, most of the important things appear to work
              as they should. We’re optimistic that the small areas the site
              falls short on will be improved as time goes on, and we are
              looking forward to seeing how they live up to our expectations in
              future Wild Casino reviews.
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>

          <p>
            All in all, we had a memorable experience at a good online casino.
            Of course, you don’t have to take our word on that when you can play
            at Wild Casino for real money right now and see for yourself.
