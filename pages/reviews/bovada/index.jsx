        <p>Here are a few reasons why we like them.</p>
        <div>

        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/the-online-sportsbook-at-bovada-lv.jpg'}/>
        <p>Looking through online betting sites? Well, Bovada offers odds on a large variety of American and international sports. Here are some of the sports you can place bets on.</p>

        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Baseball'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Soccer'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Tennis'}/>

          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Aussie Rules'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Handball'}/>
        </div>

        <p>This is only what you see on the surface, too. The coverage goes much deeper for most of the mainstream sports. For example, on the football page you’ll find betting markets for the NFL, college football, and CFL.</p>
        <p>Basketball is another example. Bovada offers odds for many leagues and events. This includes the NBA, college basketball, FIBA, European and Asian leagues, and much more.</p>
        <p>The point is that while it looks like they offer action on only 30 sports and categories, the options are far more robust than that. All you need to do is dig into a particular sport or category to find them.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Live Betting'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/all-the-in-play-betting-events.jpg'}/>
        <p>You can also bet on live sports at Bovada.lv. In-play betting is a unique experience that gives you unique betting options that would otherwise be unavailable. For example, you can bet on which player will score the next goal or who will have the lead at halftime.</p>
        <p>Of course, live betting markets will change based on what’s in season. But to give you an idea of what you mind find, our Bovada betting site review revealed live betting options for basketball, hockey, soccer, tennis, table tennis, and cricket.</p>
        <p>We also noticed they had both international and domestic events to bet on. International betting markets are an awesome addition because it’s almost a guarantee that you’ll have betting options any time of day or night.</p>

        <Borderedbox>
          <p>The only thing we disliked about the Bovada live betting feature is that the site doesn’t have live streaming for any events other than esports.</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>Instead of live streaming, Bovada.lv offers live stats that get updated throughout the game. They even have diagrams to show which team has possession at any given moment. Those live stats are better than nothing, but it’s definitely not as exciting as watching the game itself.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Bovada Betting Limits'}/>
        <p>Another important consideration when deciding whether Bovada is a good betting site is their betting limits. Their minimum bet is $0.50 in the sportsbook and $0.10 or $1 in the racebook.</p>
        <p>The maximum betting limits at Bovada varies significantly. It depends on the sport, the type of bet, and whether it’s a regular game or special event.</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p>The betting limits seem to change often too, or they vary from one account to the next, as most of the Bovada reviews we’ve read reported different maximum betting limits.</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>Our Bovada sportsbook review revealed maximum betting limits of $100 to $5,000. But you may want to create an account at Bovada anyway, if only to create a couple of test bet slips. That way, you can see what their betting limits are for the sports you want to bet on.</p>
        <TextTitle title={'Dual Pricing and Late Lines'}/>

        <p>Two common complaints we’ve seen in other reviews of Bovada is the site’s tendency to post their lines late and offer dual pricing. In 2014, Pat Morrow, the head NFL oddsmaker at Bovada, answered several betting questions in a Reddit AMA. Here’s what he had to say about their late lines.

</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p>“We get this one a lot and its dictated largely by our player base. Because our players are more of the recreational variety (smaller bets with bets coming closer to game time), we don’t traditionally see a lot of handle, especially in relation to our game day handle when we post early. In terms of raw numbers, ~80% of our wagering for an NFL event comes in about an hour before it kicks off.”
</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>Put simply, most of their customers don’t care. And unless you’re a serious bettor, odds are you won’t either.

</p>
        <p>Morrow didn’t answer the questions he got about dual lines, but we don’t need him to. We’re confident it’s true based on all the Bovada betting reviews we’ve read, and the fact that limiting and/or banning accounts is standard practice.</p>
        <p>The bottom line <b>– if you consistently win your sports wagers, online betting at Bovada might not be right for you.</b></p>

        <Title title={'Review of Bovada Casino'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/the-casino-lobby-at-bovada-lv.jpg'}/>
        <p>We love the online casino at Bovada. They have a large variety of games between their proprietary software and partnerships with software providers like Rival Gaming.</p>
        <p>Their volume of quality casino games is impressive, but that’s not all we like about them. We also appreciate how they regularly improve their casino. For example, the last time we wrote a review of Bovada.lv, they didn’t have a live dealer casino. Now they do.</p>
        <p>But is their live casino any good? What about their digital casino games – are those worth playing for real money?</p>
        <p>We’re going to answer those questions and many others in our Bovada casino review. You’ll get an idea of the types of games you can play and what we liked most and least about them. Here’s what we’ll cover.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Blackjack Games'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Table Games'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Online Slots'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Video Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Video Poker'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'Live Casino'}/>
      
        </div>

        <TextTitle title={'Blackjack Games'}/>
        <p>We found 8 blackjack variants during our Bovada.lv review.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Classic Blackjack'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Classic Single Deck Blackjack'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Double Deck Blackjack'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'European Blackjack'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Perfect Pairs'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Single Deck Blackjack'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Zappit Blackjack'}/>
        </div>

        <p>They have fewer blackjack variations than we remember seeing in past Bovada casino reviews. They also have fewer games of 21 compared to some of their rival casinos, like BetOnline.ag. That said, we think this selection will be more than enough options for everyone but the most serious real money blackjack players.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Table Games'}/>
        <p>Want to play casino table games online? You’ll have no problem finding your favorites at Bovada. Here are the games we saw during our Bovada casino review.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'American Roulette'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Baccarat'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Caribbean Hold’Em'}/>

          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Let ‘Em Ride'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Pai Gow Poker'}/>
        </div>

        <p>The most noteworthy thing about the casino table games at Bovada.lv are the new titles they’ve added, such as Teen Patti, Andar Bahar, and Roll the Dice.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Online Slots'}/>
        <p>What we like most about the slots at Bovada.lv is the variety. There are so many different types of slots to choose from, including 3 and 5-reel slots, classic slots, progressive slots, and slots with features like bonus rounds and free spins.</p>
        <p>As we said earlier, you’ll find more than 300 online slots. There’s no way we can list them all here, plus we’d like to leave you with a surprise or two if you decide to check them out for yourself. However, we do want to share a few of our favorite slots we found during our last Bovada online casino review.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Atlantic Treasures'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Lawless Ladies'}/>

          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Riches in the Rough'}/>
        </div>

        <p>Our biggest complaint is that there aren’t any licensed or branded slots. These are games based on movies, video games, comic books, and celebrities. However, this is a minor complaint since none of the US online casinos we recommend do. We may even be splitting hairs considering all the slots you can play at Bovada.lv for real money.</p>

        <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold'>Play Hot Drops Jackpots on Bovada</h3>
        <p>One thing that separates Bovada from many other casino sites is that the company that operates the site has created and licensed several of their own games. So, you can play slots from Rival Gaming, but you can also play some games that are only available on Bovada and its sister sites. For example, Gold Rush Gus and Fast and Sexy are two of the proprietary slots from this company.</p>
        <p>But Bovada wasn’t content merely offering a few games that you can’t play anywhere else. So, they created software that create an entirely new type of slot game called Hot Drops jackpots. This software was released in June 2022, so don’t be surprised if you find outdated Bovada online casino reviews that don’t mention it.</p>
        <p>There are three Hot Drops jackpots available, and each one has a different must-drop criteria. As the names suggest, the hourly and daily jackpots must drop before the end of each hour and each day, respectively. The super jackpot doesn’t drop at a certain time, but it must drop before the prize reaches a designated value.</p>
        <p>Hot Drops jackpots are different from every other progressive jackpot game because you can tell when they are about to drop. You won’t know the exact time, but as the end of the hour or day approaches, you can be sure that the jackpot will drop soon. So, you can choose the play Hot Drops jackpots when you know that the must-drop criteria is getting close to give yourself the best odds of winning.</p>





{/*         {/ leave the bosss /} */}

        <p>The best part is that the Hot Drops jackpots software can be added to several different games. So, you can play your favorite Bovada slots, like Golden Buffalo and 777 Deluxe and have a chance to win one of the three Hot Drops jackpots.</p>
        <p>Bovada has been a top-rated US online casino for many years. The site could easily keep doing the same things, and it would still be a success. But instead of taking the easy road, Bovada continuously works to provide its customers new and exciting opportunities. That is why we are constantly working to update our Bovada casino reviews and it is why it is so easy for us to continue to recommend this site.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Video Poker'}/>
        <p>We only saw a few video poker games during our review - Bonus Deuces Wild, Double Double Bonus Poker, Jacks or Better, and Joker Poker.</p>
        <p>We’re disappointed that their video poker selection shrunk a bit since our last Bovada.lv casino review. You can play some of these in a 1-, 3-, and 10-hand format, if that’s any consolation.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Specialty Games'}/>
        <p>There are several games you can play at Bovada.lv that don’t quite fit in one of the categories above.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bingo Goal'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bingo Cataratas'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Amazonia Bingo'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Thundercrash'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bingo Ribeirinhos'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Tribo Bingo'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Go-Go Bingo'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Keno Draw'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Pesca bingo'}/>
        </div>

        <p>There’s not much else to report here. They’ve changed their selection of specialty games since we last reviewed Bovada – specifically, there are more bingo games. That’s great if you’re a fan of online bingo, but less so if you prefer keno or scratch cards.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Live Casino'}/>
        <p>Another way to enjoy the online casino at Bovada is to check out the live dealer casino. Their live casino games are operated by Visionary iGaming. You can play blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and super six with a real dealer.</p>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/we-were-surprised-to-see-a-live-dealer-casino-while-reviewing-bovada.jpg'}/>
        <p>There are many different dealers to choose from, including both male and female dealers. The dealer’s picture is displayed in the lobby, so you’ll know who you’ll be playing with before you even start the game.</p>
        <p>If you’re a low-stakes player, you can find betting limits as low as $5-$100. High-stakes players can join the high-limit tables and bet up to $2,500 or $3,000. There is even one blackjack table that accepts bets up to $5,000.</p>
        <p>The live casino is a fantastic addition to the Bovada casino because it offers a more authentic experience. It also means that their casino is no longer lagging their competitors.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Playing Online Poker at Bovada'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/the-online-poker-room-at-bovada-lv.jpg'}/>
        <p>Bovada has offered online poker since the original brand, Bodog, launched in 2004. Back then, they were a second-tier poker room behind favorites such as PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker.</p>
        <p>But now? Now they’re a top poker room in the US. They fluctuate between the top 2-3 spots in terms of traffic, which means you should almost always be able to find a game running. This is great since US poker traffic was decapitated after Black Friday.</p>
        <p>The games are relatively soft at Bovada.lv, too. We believe there are a couple of reasons why.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Most (if not all) US poker pros either quit or moved after Black Friday.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bovada caters to recreational poker players. They say as much, but it’s also evident between their anonymous poker tables and their prohibiting HUD tracking software like PokerTracker.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'There is a lot of crossover traffic from the sportsbook and casino.'}/>
        </div>
        <p>Ultimately, if you’re a recreational poker player who likes to get in a few hands in every night or grind a few Sunday majors, Bovada might be right for you.</p>
        <p>However, if you want to know a little more about their poker room before you create an account, then continue reading our Bovada poker room review. We’ll cover some additional details about their cash games and online poker tournament schedule.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Bovada Poker Cash Games'}/>
        <p>Bovada spreads a small selection of poker games that includes Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and Omaha Hi/Lo. You can play heads-up, 6-max, and full ring cash games at stakes ranging from $0.02/$0.05 to $10/$20.

</p>
        <p>These games can be crazy soft. It’s not uncommon to see flop percentages in the 30%-40% range for full-ring games and 50% flop percentages for 6-max games.</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p>You won’t steal many blinds in Bovada’s cash games, but you WILL have the chance to win massive pots. Many Bovada online poker reviews report pot sizes of between 30x-40x the big blind.</p>
        </Borderedbox>

        <p>Surprisingly, their fast fold games, which Bovada.lv calls Zone Poker, are about 10%-15% tighter. But since you’ll play far more hands in this format, you should still get to see plenty of flops. The volume should help make up for the lower stakes too, seeing as the Zone Poker games max out at $1/$2 blinds.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Bovada Poker Tournaments'}/>
        <p>The multi-table tournament schedule at Bovada is the best for US players. You’ll find both a robust daily tournament schedule as well as several Sunday majors. Bovada guarantees more than $1.5-$2 million in tourney prize money every week.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the poker tournaments Bovada.lv hosts every week.</p> 


   {/*      {/ levae the table /} */}
        <p>To be fair, this doesn’t even scrap the surface of all the poker tournaments at Bovada. Our Bovada poker review will never do their tournament schedule justice because it’s simply impractical for us to list all the tourneys they run.</p>
        <p>There’s no way we could keep up with all their limited time events, either.</p>
        <p>For example, during this Bovada review they were running their Million Dollar Weekend event. This is a limited time poker series they run every so often. For this event, they were guaranteeing $1.1 million in prize money over only four days and 20 events. Two of their tourneys boasted six-figure prize pools.</p>
        <p>The bottom line – the Bovada.lv poker room has a lot to offer, much more than we can cover here. If you want to play real money poker online in the US, you’re not going to find any better than them.

        <Title title={'Mobile Gambling on Bovada'}/>
        <p>Everything you love about Bovada is available anywhere you go, thanks to the Bovada mobile gambling site. As long as you have access to the internet, you can access Bovada on your phone or tablet.</p>
        <p>Bovada uses mobile-responsive software, so the site you see on your phone is almost the same as the site you see on your computer. The primary differences are the size of displays and navigation menus.</p>
        <p>You don’t have to download a native Bovada app to access it, either. Instead, just type Bovada.lv in the URL search bar on your device. You can also add a bookmark to your home screen to easily access Bovada with a single tap.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'What Can I Do On the Bovada Mobile App?'}/>
        <p>Our review of the Bovada mobile site revealed that it has all the same sports betting, casino, and poker options available. You can even access the live dealer casino and horse racebook from your phone.</p>
        <p>In fact, Bovada takes it one step further than most mobile gambling apps. Not only can you access the same games you would find on your computer, but you can find a few mobile exclusive games too.</p>
        <p>For example, Jackpot Pinatas is a progressive jackpot slot game you can only play from the Bovada mobile site. If you search for that game on the desktop site, you will not find it. It ONLY comes up when you search for it on your phone.</p>
        <Borderedbox>
          <p>You can also use the mobile site to process deposits and withdrawals, collect bonuses, and view helpful articles. Anything you can do on the desktop site is available from your mobile device.</p>
        </Borderedbox>
        <p>We were very impressed with our review of Bovada on our mobile devices. It functions similarly to the desktop site, so you’ll know exactly what to expect. You can’t ask for more than that.</p>
        <p>If you want to learn more about their mobile gambling options, then read our Bovada app review.</p>

        <p>Bovada has a variety of bonuses and promotions available for new and existing customers. The various bonus offers make it easy for players to choose the promotional offer that works for them.</p>
        <p>Here’s a bit of information about the bonuses we found during our Bovada review.</p>

        <div className='green'>
          <TextTitle title={'Bovada Welcome Bonuses'}/>
          <p>There are three different welcome bonuses to choose from. Each one is designed for gamblers who want to enjoy the different gambling opportunities that Bovada offers.</p>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Sports bettors can get a 50% deposit match up to $250. The rollover is only 5x the deposit and bonus amount as long as you only use it for sports wagers and horse race betting.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Casino players can get a 100% match on their first three deposits. If you maximize the bonus offer, you can receive a total of $3,000 in bonus money. The rollover requirement is 25x, but bets on craps or live dealer games do not contribute to the playthrough.'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bovada also has a welcome bonus for poker players. They can receive a 100% deposit match of up to $500. This online casino bonus has no rollover requirement, but the bonus funds are released in $5 increments based on your poker activity.'}/>

        </div>

        <p>These bonus offers are very competitive if you compare Bovada to other US sportsbooks and casino sites. Some gambling sites have higher bonus limits, but Bovada tends to have lower rollover requirements. We feel like Bovada strikes a great balance between size and rollover.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Bitcoin Bonuses on Bovada'}/>
        <p>Before you claim a welcome bonus on Bovada, you may want to consider their Bitcoin welcome bonuses. These welcome bonuses are only available on your first deposit, so you need to decide which offer you want to take advantage of before processing your deposit.</p>
        <p>There are two welcome bonuses for Bitcoin deposits. They’re like the basic welcome bonuses, but the bonus limits are higher. For example, instead of claiming $3,000 in casino bonuses, you can claim $3,750 when you make your first three deposits with Bitcoin. The match percentage also increases from 100% to 125%.</p>
        <p>Sports bettors can get a 75% deposit match of up to $750. That is an excellent option because it triples the amount of bonus cash you can get for sports betting – just for depositing with Bitcoin.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Bitcoin Exclusive Membership'}/>
        <p>Another exciting promotion for Bovada members is the Bitcoin Exclusive Membership program. As long as you know that you plan to use crypto for all your deposits and withdrawals, you can upgrade your account to get more rewards.

</p>
        <p>The Bitcoin Exclusive Membership offers a 50% deposit match on any deposit of $30 or more. You also get 25 free spins and 15,000 rewards points for each of those qualifying deposits.</p>
        <p>These benefits are available any time, but you can only collect them one time each week. The only way to access these benefits is to upgrade your account to the Bitcoin Exclusive Membership.</p>
        <p>Bovada has several cryptocurrency banking options. These Bitcoin bonuses are available for deposits using Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Bitcoin SV, and Ethereum.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Bovada Rewards Program'}/>
        <p>The last promotion we want to cover in our Bovada.lv review is the Bovada rewards program. It’s an automatic program that allows you to earn rewards points for every bet you make on Bovada. Here is a breakdown of the number of points you earn for various betting options on Bovada.</p>

       {/*  {/ leave the table /} */}

         <p>You can start redeeming those rewards points for cash as soon as you get to 2,500 points. The redemption rate starts at $1 for every 2,500 points, but it changes as you increase your level in the program. At the top levels, you can get $1 for every 1,000 points. Bovada tracks your points over the lifetime of your account. So, you won’t lose your rewards level when you redeem your points for cash.</p>
        <p>The Bovada rewards program makes it easy to earn points and easy to trade them for cash rewards. It’s a straightforward program that rewards players for their loyalty to the site.

         <Title title={'Banking Options at Bovada'}/>
        <p>Another critical aspect we need to cover in our review of Bovada is the banking options. American gamblers often have issues with online gambling transactions, but Bovada has enough banking methods to make it easy for most customers.

</p>
        <p>Here is an overview of the deposit and withdrawal methods available on Bovada.</p>


      {/*   {/ leave th etable  /} */}

        <p>The most disappointing aspect of Bovada’s banking methods is the transaction fees for credit card deposits. Most online gambling sites offer free deposits, no matter which banking method you choose.</p>
        <p>Charging more than 15% for a deposit is a pretty steep fee, and your credit card company may charge additional fees on top of that. Bovada covers the in-house fee for your first deposit, but you will probably want to switch to a different banking method after that.</p>
        <p>We would also like to see a wider variety of cryptocurrency banking methods. Bovada has the basics covered, but they could expand their options to include altcoins like XRP, USD Coin, or Stellar.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, everything else about the deposit and payout methods at Bovada.lv meets or exceeds our standards.</p>

        <Title title={'Customer Support from Bovada'}/>
        <p>One of the best features Bovada offers is comprehensive customer support. But how do you get help when you need it?</p>
        <p>The first thing you should do is visit the help center. You can find this by clicking the account icon and then help. This will take you to a directory of sorts where you can type your question or a keyword in the search bar. Or you can browse articles by clicking on one of the following topics.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Sports and Events'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Casino'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Live Dealer'}/>

          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Player Transfer'}/>
        
        </div>
        <p>These help center articles are detailed and incredibly helpful, so they’re the best place to find the information you need. But sometimes, you just need to talk to someone. However, there is no contact information link on any of the main Bovada pages. That’s because they want you to use the help center first.</p>

        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/where-to-find-bovadas-contact-information.jpg'}/>
        <p>If you still need help, you’ll notice that at the bottom of every help center article there is a textbox that says, “did you find what you were looking for?” If you click no, then you’ll see several options for contacting Bovada to get more information. You can email them to get a response within 48 hours or use the live chat feature to talk to someone 24/7.</p>
        <p>The bottom line is that Bovada has several customer service options that guarantee you’ll always be able to get the help you need.</p>

        <Title title={'Bovada vs. Other US Sportsbooks'}/>
        <p>Bovada is one of the top online gambling sites in the US. But many customers want to know how it compares to its competitors. Many Bovada.lv reviews only give you information about Bovada itself, but we want to make sure you have all the information you need. Here is an overview of the features that Bovada offers compared to other top USA gambling sites.</p>

      {/*   {/ leave the tabel /} */}
 
        <p>Now that you have an idea of some of the features that Bovada and its competitors offer, we want to help you decide which site is best for you. Below, we compare Bovada to other gambling sites in more detail and explain which features may appeal to specific customers.</p>


        <TextTitle title={'Bovada vs. BetOnline'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/bovada-versus-betonline.jpg'}/>
        <p>Both Bovada and BetOnline are all-in-one gambling sites that offer sports betting, casino games, and poker.</p>
        <p>Casino players may prefer BetOnline because it has games from multiple software providers. Betsoft’s 3D slot games are particularly popular, and you can’t play Betsoft slots on Bovada.</p>
        <p>However, the casino welcome bonus at Bovada offers a higher bonus amount and a lower rollover requirement. So, if the bonus offer is more important to you than the game variety, Bovada is a better choice.

</p>
        <p>The primary difference for sports bettors will be the bonus offers. BetOnline offers a higher welcome bonus for sports and has additional promotions that go beyond your first deposit.</p>
        <p>That should give you the gist of how BetOnline.ag compares to Bovada. If you want to learn more about them, then we recommend you read our BetOnline review.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'MyBookie vs. Bovada'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/bovada-versus-my-bookie.jpg'}/>
        <p>MyBookie is another site like Bovada, but it does not offer live poker. If you want to play poker tournaments, Bovada is the best choice for you.</p>
        <p>The sportsbook on Bovada and MyBookie are similar. You can find similar betting markets on both sites, and both sites offer live betting and a props builder. But because these sportsbooks are so similar, you might want to create an account on both sites. Then, you can compare the odds for each wager you want to place and use whichever site has the best odds.</p>
        <p>Casino players should consider the software providers that both sites offer. Bovada uses Rival Gaming software, and MyBookie has games from Betsoft. Games from Betsoft tend to be more popular, and they have better graphics. However, Bovada stopped offering Betsoft games because Betsoft was accused of not paying players who won progressive jackpots several years ago.</p>
        <p>If you prefer games from one software provider or another, that should help you choose between Bovada and MyBookie. Our MyBookie review can also help you decide.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Bovada vs. BetUS'}/>
        <Squareimage src={'/image/reviews/bovada-versus-betus.jpg'}/>


        <p>BetUS is the last site we want to compare with Bovada. It has a top-rated sportsbook with more than 20,000 betting markets to choose from. Many people prefer the BetUS sportsbook because it has so many betting options. But, you might prefer Bovada if you are looking for a props builder. Unfortunately, BetUS doesn’t have a props builder feature.</p>
   
  
         <p>Similarly, there are specific features that stand out for both sites casino games. For example, Bovada has more multi-hand video poker games and has more options for specialty games. BetUS has more slots games, but Bovada has more progressive jackpot slots.</p>
 
  
        <p>Another factor to consider is the fact that the BetUS loyalty program only allows you to earn loyalty points with sports betting wagers. If you plan on playing casino games, you might as well use Bovada because then you can earn loyalty points for all your wagers.</p>
        <p>Both sites have their pros and cons, so you need to choose which features are most important to you. That will be the fastest and easiest way to determine which gambling site is best for you. You can learn more about BetUS features by reading the following review. </p>

        <div>
   {/*        {/ image /} */}
           <p>We already answered this question earlier, but now that we’re about done reviewing Bovada, it’s time to revisit it. Is Bovada.lv legit? The answer is still the same – yes, they are!</p>
          <p>You’d be hard-pressed to find a better all-in-one gambling site. For starters, there are few online gambling sites that offer more than sports betting and casino games. But Bovada has online poker, too.</p>
          <p>They also do each thing well.</p>
