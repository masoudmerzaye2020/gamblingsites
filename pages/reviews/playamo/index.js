    <Header>Playamo Casino Review</Header>
    <Section>
        <Container>
            <p>If you are looking for a new casino site, you will definitely want to consider Playamo.com. We would love to pinpoint exactly what kind of gambler should choose this site, but the truth is that Playamo has something for everyone.</p>
            <p>The site offers more than 3,500 games from more than fifty software providers, so the collection covers almost every game you could hope for. Low-budget players can deposit as low as A$10 with most banking methods and bet as low as $0.10 per spin on some games. But the site also has high roller bonuses, and VIPs even have a chance to win a Ferrari.</p>
            <p>Anyway, those are a few of the many reasons why we were excited to write this review of Playamo. We hope you’ll feel the same way, but you’ll have to read the review to find out.</p>
            <p>We’ve done our best to present you with an honest, unbiased look at Playamo in 2022. That way you can make an informed decision about whether you think you’ll like playing here or not.</p>
            <p>With that in mind, let’s jump into our Playamo casino review.</p>

            <Title title={'Basic Information'}/>
            <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/playamo-review-basic-information-1.png'}/>
            <p>Playamo Casino is owned and operated by Dama N.V. (formerly Direx N.V.) The same company also owns other Bitcoin sites like BitStarz Casino, Play Casino and QueenSpin Casino. The site launched in 2016, so they have had several years to establish its reputation.</p>
            <p>Curacao e-Gaming Authority licenses the Playamo casino, so the site must follow Curacao’s gambling laws and standards. The site’s license is a sub-license from Antillephone N.V., which is one of four companies in Curacao that have a master license.</p>
            <p>The site’s backend software comes from Softswiss N.V. This is worth noting because Softswiss is a gambling software developer with a focus on Bitcoin casinos, and Softswiss has its own Curacao gambling license. They have more than 3,500 games on their platform from more than 50 of the industry’s best developers. That includes the likes of NetEnt, Microgaming, Evolution, Amatic and EGT.

</p>
            <p>You excited yet? You should be!</p>
            <p>Other players certainly are. Softswiss’ platforms process more than €7 billion in monthly bets and have launched more than 100 casinos since 2008.</p>
            <p>Softswiss also happens to be the #1 provider for crypto casinos, like Playamo.</p>
            <p></p>

            <TextTitle title={'Restricted Countries'}/>
            <p>Players from the following countries cannot play at Playamo Casino:

</p>
            <div>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Albania'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Belarus'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={''}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={''}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={''}/>
            </div>

            <p>There are also many games that are prohibited to players in certain countries. If this is something you’re concerned about or if you have a specific software provider or game in mind you want to play, then we recommend you read their terms and conditions to see if it’s available to you.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Customer Support'}/>
            <p>Playamo Casino offers support via the following channels:</p>
            <p>EMAIL: support@playamo.com</p>
            <p>LIVE CHAT</p>
            <p>You can also send an email using the form on their contact page.</p>
            <p>We sent them an email during our Playamo online casino review and heard back from them in less than 2 hours. We’ll give them two thumbs up for that!</p>
            
            <Title title={'Playamo Casino Review'}/>
            <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/playamo-review-casino-section-1.jpg'}/>
            <p>Let’s talk about our Playamo online casino review. There are more than 3,500 games available, which is a lot of games to cover. Fortunately, the game lobby is well-organized, so you can use different categories to help you narrow down the list of games.

</p>
            <p>The categories include new games, slots, bonus buys, live casino, blackjack, bitcoin games, scratch cards, and instant wins. There is some overlap between several of these categories. For example, the bitcoin games category includes several games that are also listed in the slots category. You can use bitcoin to make your bets on bitcoin games, but many of those same games are also available for fiat currency bettors.</p>

          {/*   {/ leave the tips /} */}

            <p>We will continue our review of Playamo Casino by exploring many of the games in some of these categories. However, it is important to know that some games may not be available in your location. Each software provider has different restrictions on where their games can be played.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Table Games'}/>
            <p>The first thing you’ll notice is that Playamo Casino doesn’t have your standard table or card games sections. Instead, you’ll find blackjack, roulette, live casino and Bitcoin games.

</p>
            <p>This is unnecessary. We’d rather have all the table and card games under one heading with filters you can use to weed out the games you don’t want to play.</p>
            <p>This is especially important here, as they have several table games that aren’t easy to find. We didn’t know they existed until we used the search feature. That’s how we find three-card rummy, craps, and casino war. Unfortunately, this means that lots of players don’t even know they exist.</p>
            <Borderedbox>
                <p>Note: If you make your web browser smaller or visit their mobile casino, you’ll notice that they do have a table game heading. This combines their blackjack and roulette sections together. It’s not clear why they don’t do this for their desktop casino.</p>
            </Borderedbox>
            <p>Anyway, here are some of the table games you’ll find here:</p>
            <div>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'European Blackjack'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack Multihand Pro'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack Surrender'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Pontoon'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Double Exposure BJ'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Single Deck Blackjack'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Super 7 Blackjack'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'21 Burn Blackjack'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack Pragmatic Play'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Atlantic City Blackjack'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'American Roulette'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'French Roulette'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'VIP European Roulette'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'VIP American Roulette'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Caribbean Poker'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Triple Edge Poker'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Trey Poker'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Ride’m Poker'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Poker3 Heads Up'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Oasis Poker'}/>
            </div>
            <p>They offer live casino games, too. We’ll show you some examples of the live dealer games you can play in just a second.</p>
            <p>The most difficult thing for us was finding all their card games. We had to use their search feature to uncover games we didn’t see in their main sections. We recommend you do the same if you know what games you’re looking for. You can also filter games by software provider. Nucleus Gaming, Betsoft, and BGaming are all providers that offer several table games.</p>
            <p>That’s about the extent of the downsides, though.</p>
            <p>The graphics look good and the games are intuitive to use. You can also check them out for play money first before you commit to playing with real money.</p>
            <p>Their table limits start at $1. The highest table limits we found are $500, though most tables we found peaked at $100.</p>
            <p>You can also play their table games from your mobile web browser. This will go for iOS, Android and any other device that can use one of the popular web browsers.

</p>
            <TextTitle title={'Video Poker'}/>
            <p>Next up, their video poker games.</p>
            <p>It was difficult for us to see what video poker games they have because they don’t have a dedicated section for them.</p>
            <p>We had to improvise by using their search bar and our knowledge of what video poker games exist. If you don’t have that knowledge, then you’re going to struggle to find their games.</p>
            <p>The good news is that we listed the games we found below. Here’s what we found:

</p>

            <div>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Pyramid Joker Poker'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Pyramid Bonus Poker'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Jacks or Better'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Wild Texas'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Joker Poker'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Multi-hand All American'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Pyramid Deuces Wild'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Multi-hand Deuces Wild'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Deuces Wild'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Deuces and Jokers'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bonus Deuces'}/>
               
            </div>
            <p>If you want to play any of them, simply type the game into the search bar and it’ll come up if it’s available to you.</p>
            <p>You can’t fail typing in poker, video, jacks, pyramid or joker, either.</p>
            <p>As for stakes, they vary; we found machines that let you wager anywhere from $0.40 to $100 for 100 hands.

</p>
            <p>The graphics looked okay, though this largely depends on the machine you play (and the software provider who created it). Some video poker machines look like they’re 30 years old, while others look like they were created recently.</p>

            <Borderedbox>
                <p>What’s important, though, is that every machine we tested worked.</p>
            </Borderedbox>
            <p>That goes for mobile users, too. However, because there’s not a dedicated video poker section, it was difficult to find any poker games from our smartphone. It’s also difficult to truly gauge how many titles they have for mobile users.</p>
            <p>And while their mobile graphics looked good, we thought that the jacks or better machine we tested was too small. It didn’t utilize the full screen, which made it difficult to see and use.

</p>
            <p>That said, your mileage may vary since phone and tablet screen sizes vary.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Slots'}/>
            <p>Here’s a few of the slot machines we tested during our Playamo Casino review:</p>

            <div>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Aztec Magic'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Brave Viking'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Platinum Lightning'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Desert Treasure'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Princess Royal'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Hot Seven'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Zeus the Thunderer'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Year of The Tiger'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Zombie Town'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Wolf Night'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Wicked Circus'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Weekend in Vegas'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Under the Bed'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'The Slotfather II'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'More Gold Diggin’'}/>
            </div>
            <p>And more!</p>
            <p>They have a unique and diverse selection of games.</p>
            <p>Playamo also has a robust selection of 3D slots, thanks to their partnership with Betsoft. These are Betsoft’s claim to fame. They’re worth checking out, even if you only play them for free.

</p>
            <p>Some of our favorite 3D titles include Under the Bed, The Slot Father and Madder Scientist.</p>
            <p>No matter what slots you enjoy playing, though, you’ll find them here. And that’s because Playamo works with some of the best software developers in the industry.</p>
            <p>For example, you can play slots from:

</p>
            <p></p>

            <div>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Amatic'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Belatra'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Betsoft gaming'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'EGT'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Endorphina'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Evolution'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Ezugi'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'GameArt'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Habanero'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'iSoftBet'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Play’n GO'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Pragmatic Play'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Quickfire'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'SoftSwiss'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Spinomenal'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Yggdrasil'}/>
            </div>
            <p>It’s no wonder why this is the strongest section in their casino.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Live Dealer Games'}/>
            <p>Last up, Playamo’s live casino.</p>
            <p>They offer a relatively large and diverse selection of live dealer games from Evolution Gaming, Atmosfera, Lucky Streak Gaming and several other live casino studios. Some of the games you can play include:</p>

            <div>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Auto Roulette La Partage'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Auto Roulette'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Dream Catcher'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Baccarat'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Live Baccarat'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Auto Roulette VIP'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Baccarat Squeeze'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Casino Hold’em'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack VIP'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack White'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack Grand VIP'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Immersive Roulette'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Blackjack Platinum VIP'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bet on Numbers'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Auto Roulette'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Russian Live Blackjack'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Live Keno'}/>
            </div>
            <p>And more!</p>
            <p>Right off the bat, we noticed they offered a few games you don’t see offered (live) often. For example, keno and bet on numbers.</p>
            <p>We also found several variants. For example, you can choose between male or female dealers. You can also choose the language they speak; we found dealers that spoke Russian, Spanish and Turkish.</p>
            <p>Another unique thing about their live dealer games is that the Ezugi tables offer the option to play for fun. This is almost unheard of, as live dealer games are like offline table games; seats are limited. Online casinos don’t let you play for fun because that’s a seat a paying player could otherwise occupy.</p>
            <p>Only some games are available to play for fun, but we were impressed that the option is available at all. We also noticed that Playamo has several digital table games mixed in with their live casino games. Their site would be more organized if the live games were separated from digital games.</p>
            <Borderedbox>
                <p>The betting limits vary based on the game you choose, but most games allow bets between $5 and $1,000. However, Evolution Gaming also offers high-roller live games that can accept bets as high as $75,000.</p>
            </Borderedbox>
            <p>We were impressed with the live casino during our Playamo review. Because the site works with several software providers, players have hundreds of exciting games to choose from.</p>
            <Title title={'Banking Options'}/>
            <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/playamo-review-banking-options-1.jpg'}/>
            <p>Chances are you’ve heard of Bitcoin before.</p>
            <p>If not, it’s a crypto (virtual) currency that’s been in the news the past couple of years. This is partly because it’s a new “investment” vehicle and partly because its value has fluctuated wildly since its inception.</p>
            <p>We’re talking $500 one day, $5,000 the next. Or, $17,000 one day, a crash the next.</p>
            <p>We’ve written a full guide to Bitcoin gambling, so we won’t cover too much information here. But it is something that Playamo offers, so we want to at least mention it. If you don’t know anything about it, much less care, that’s okay. Because Playamo is a hybrid casino, you can join and play with regular money instead.</p>
            <p>But if you want to know about it, including why you might want to use it, we recommend you check out our other resources before continuing with this review.</p>
            <p>It’s because Playamo accepts Bitcoin that we were so interested in writing this review. They’re one of those hybrid casinos that let you deposit and play in both crypto and fiat currencies.</p>
            <p>There are several reasons why this matters:</p>
            <div>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'It brings normal and Bitcoin software developers together to create a unique list of games rarely found elsewhere.'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'It means that there may be games you’ve never seen or played before.'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Some Bitcoin games allow you to check whether they’re provably fair. You can’t do this with normal casino games.'}/>
            </div>
            <p>No one ever complained about having too many banking options before either.</p>
            <p>Of course, Bitcoin is only one of the banking methods you can use on Playamo. They also accept credit cards, e-wallets, and several other crypto coins. The following are the banking options accepted at Playamo Casino. We’ve also listed their fees, processing time frame, limits and overall thoughts.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Deposits'}/>
            <p>The payment options Playamo Casino accepts, as well as their limits and fees, include:</p>
           {/*  {/ leve the table /} */}
            <p>The $4,000 deposit limit on most of these options seems low, but there are plenty of convenient options for high rollers, like Skrill and any of the crypto options. We love that they never charge deposit fees.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Withdrawals'}/>
            <p>Your options for cash outs include:</p>
            {/* {/ leve the table /} */}
            <p>The minimum cash out is $10 for most banking methods. This is great, as it’s within range of players on the tiniest of budgets.</p>
            <Borderedbox>
                <p>Remember that cryptocurrency values change constantly. Playamo may change its transaction limits based on the current value of specific coins. Check the payments page for the latest information.</p>
            </Borderedbox>

            <Title title={'Playamo Review of Bonuses and Promotions'}/>
            <Wideimage src={'/image/reviews/playamo-review-bonuses-promotions-1.jpg'}/>
            <p>Playamo has 5 bonuses running right now. Here are the details for each one.</p>

            <Mainbullet link={''} title={'First Deposit Bonus'} desc={'– Make your first deposit, and you’ll receive a 100% match bonus up to $100. This bonus also comes with 100 free spins for you to use on the Elvis Frog in Vegas slot machine. You’ll receive the free spins twenty at a time over a five-day period.'}/>
            <p>You’ll want to keep in mind that this offer has a 50x playthrough that applies only to the bonus amount (not your deposit). That goes for your winnings from the free spins too. Make sure to read the terms and conditions for this bonus because there are also restrictions on how much you can bet and win with the active bonus.</p>
