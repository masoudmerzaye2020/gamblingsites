          <TextTitle title={'Getting Started With Crypto Online Gambling'}/>
          <p>The whole process of gambling online with cryptocurrencies is fairly simple. Let’s take a look at all the steps you’ll have to go through.</p>

          {/* leave the bellow style */}

          <p>As you can see, gambling with crypto online is not too complicated and you should be able to get used to it quite fast. If you do have any issues, all of these sites have customer support staff available. They’re there to help you if you need it.</p>

          <Title title={'Pros and Cons of Using Crypto for Online Gambling'}/>
          <p>Now that you know HOW to gamble online with cryptocurrency, the question is SHOULD you?</p>
          <p>US customers should definitely consider using cryptos for their online betting and gaming. It’s just so much better than the other payment methods using traditional currency.</p>
          <p>But it’s not only for those living in the USA. There are some benefits to gambling online with cryptocurrencies that apply wherever you live. To help you decide if crypto gaming is for you, let’s take a look at the pros and cons.</p>

          {/* leave the box style */}

          <p>The upsides of using Bitcoin and other cryptos are clear. It doesn’t matter what form of gambling you enjoy, or how much you gamble with, there’s a strong case for cryptocurrencies being your best option. If you play for high stakes, it’s almost a no-brainer.</p>

          {/* Image place */}

          <p>Naturally, there are downsides as well. Before you invest your money in cryptocurrencies and start gambling with them, make sure you’re aware of the drawbacks. Here are the main ones.</p>

          {/* leave the red box */}

          <p>While we feel that the advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages, you have to consider the downsides of internet gambling with crypto before getting started.</p>
          <p>If you feel comfortable with the potential issues, remember that you don’t have to dive in with thousands of dollars. You can start by using relatively small amounts of cash.</p>

          <Title title={'Crypto-Only Gambling Sites vs. Traditional Sites'}/>
          <p>There are two main types of online gambling sites that work with cryptocurrencies.</p>
          <div>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Crypto-only platforms that don’t accept other currencies.'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Traditional gambling websites that have started accepting BTC and other coins at some point.'}/>
          </div>
          <p>Both options have their merits, and you’re not limited to one or the other. We’ll compare the two for you, though, to help you decide which might be better for you.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Gambling Sites That Work Only with Crypto'}/>

          <p>First in line are the sites that accept cryptocurrencies and nothing else. You can ONLY make deposits and withdrawals using a digital asset like Bitcoin. This seems restrictive, but actually leads to certain positives.</p>
          <p>For example, these online crypto operators usually don’t ask for verification and some won’t even ask for your name. You can stay private and enjoy poker, cryptocurrency betting, and casino games from many countries that are usually restrictive when it comes to online gambling.</p>

          {/* image place */}

          <p>There’s another benefit here, as some of the games have another layer of protection when it comes to fair play. The so-called “provably fair” approach uses the power of the different blockchains to make sure that the outcomes are truly random and can’t be hacked or manipulated in any way.</p>
          <p>On the downside, the quality of crypto-only sites is usually a little lower than the traditional sites. For example, they typically have fewer games and less poker traffic. In most cases, the overall experience can be a little disappointing.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Traditional Gambling Sites that Accept Crypto'}/>

          <p>If you don’t want to try crypto-only sites, you can always choose more reputable sites and apps that have been around for a while. Many of them now accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
          <p>They offer the best of both worlds in many ways, so it’s a sensible decision. Here are some of our suggestions if that’s your preferred choice.</p>
