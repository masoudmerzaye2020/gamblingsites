            Let’s take a more detailed at how online crypto gambling works,
            starting with the different options at your disposal.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Which Cryptos Can You Use?"} />
          <p>
            Most people have heard about Bitcoin by now, and it remains the most
            popular cryptocurrency by quite some distance. All of the top crypto
            gambling websites accept BTC. It’s not your only option, though.
            Several other cryptocurrencies can be used for deposits and
            withdrawals. Here’s what you need to know about Bitcoin and its
            alternatives.

          <p>
            The whole process of gambling online with cryptocurrencies is fairly
            simple. Let’s take a look at all the steps you’ll have to go
            through.
          </p>

          {/* leave the bellow style */}

          <p>
            As you can see, gambling with crypto online is not too complicated
            and you should be able to get used to it quite fast. If you do have
            any issues, all of these sites have customer support staff
            available. They’re there to help you if you need it.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Pros and Cons of Using Crypto for Online Gambling"} />
          <p>
            Now that you know HOW to gamble online with cryptocurrency, the
            question is SHOULD you?
          </p>
          <p>
            US customers should definitely consider using cryptos for their
            online betting and gaming. It’s just so much better than the other
            payment methods using traditional currency.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it’s not only for those living in the USA. There are some
            benefits to gambling online with cryptocurrencies that apply
            wherever you live. To help you decide if crypto gaming is for you,
            let’s take a look at the pros and cons.
          </p>

          {/* leave the box style */}

          <p>
            The upsides of using Bitcoin and other cryptos are clear. It doesn’t
            matter what form of gambling you enjoy, or how much you gamble with,
            there’s a strong case for cryptocurrencies being your best option.
            If you play for high stakes, it’s almost a no-brainer.
          </p>

          {/* Image place */}

          <p>
            Naturally, there are downsides as well. Before you invest your money
            in cryptocurrencies and start gambling with them, make sure you’re
            aware of the drawbacks. Here are the main ones.
          </p>

          {/* leave the red box */}

          <p>
            While we feel that the advantages definitely outweigh the
            disadvantages, you have to consider the downsides of internet
            gambling with crypto before getting started.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you feel comfortable with the potential issues, remember that you
            don’t have to dive in with thousands of dollars. You can start by
            using relatively small amounts of cash.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Crypto-Only Gambling Sites vs. Traditional Sites"} />
          <p>
            There are two main types of online gambling sites that work with
            cryptocurrencies.
          </p>
          <div>
            <Mainbullet
              link={""}
              desc={"Crypto-only platforms that don’t accept other currencies."}
            />
            <Mainbullet
              link={""}
              desc={
                "Traditional gambling websites that have started accepting BTC and other coins at some point."
              }
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Both options have their merits, and you’re not limited to one or the
            other. We’ll compare the two for you, though, to help you decide
            which might be better for you.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Gambling Sites That Work Only with Crypto"} />

          <p>
            First in line are the sites that accept cryptocurrencies and nothing
            else. You can ONLY make deposits and withdrawals using a digital
            asset like Bitcoin. This seems restrictive, but actually leads to
            certain positives.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, these online crypto operators usually don’t ask for
            verification and some won’t even ask for your name. You can stay
            private and enjoy poker, cryptocurrency betting, and casino games
            from many countries that are usually restrictive when it comes to
            online gambling.
          </p>

          {/* image place */}

          <p>
            There’s another benefit here, as some of the games have another
            layer of protection when it comes to fair play. The so-called
            “provably fair” approach uses the power of the different blockchains
            to make sure that the outcomes are truly random and can’t be hacked
            or manipulated in any way.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the downside, the quality of crypto-only sites is usually a
            little lower than the traditional sites. For example, they typically
            have fewer games and less poker traffic. In most cases, the overall
            experience can be a little disappointing.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Traditional Gambling Sites that Accept Crypto"} />

          <p>
            If you don’t want to try crypto-only sites, you can always choose
            more reputable sites and apps that have been around for a while.
            Many of them now accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            They offer the best of both worlds in many ways, so it’s a sensible
            decision. Here are some of our suggestions if that’s your preferred
            choice.
          </p>

          {/* LEAVE THE ADD */}
          <p>
            As you can see, the top online gambling sites accepting
            cryptocurrency have been around for years. The betting sites and
            online casinos listed here are some of the very best around, period.
            We recommend them whether you want to use cryptocurrency OR
            traditional currency.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Tips for Gambling Online with Cryptocurrency"} />
          <p>
            Before you start using crypto to gamble online, we have some tips
            you should read. They will help improve your overall experience and
            even increase your chances of winning money.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Stick to the Most Popular Coins"} />
          <p>
            There are so many cryptocurrencies out there nowadays, and tracking
            them can be confusing. The best cryptocurrency sites are adding more
            and more of them to their platforms, but we recommend sticking to
            the mainstream options like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash.
            Here are some of the reasons we recommend choosing these mainstream
            coins.

            You can always try your luck with smaller coins, but we really don’t

          <TextTitle title={"Keep Your Bankroll in a Stable Coin"} />

          <p>
            One of the biggest problems with online crypto gambling is that the
            price of most currencies is very volatile. You might withdraw some
            cash and lose a lot of value if the price goes down before you
            transfer it to your bank.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s a relatively simple way to mitigate the risks by keeping
            most of your bankroll outside of the crypto online gambling sites
            and in a stable coin. Most wallets offer some sort of solution that
            will allow you to maintain the value of your money.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Be Extra Careful With Security"} />
          <p>
            We already mentioned how one of the downsides with crypto on the
            internet is the potential for hacking. You should stay extra careful
            and follow all best practices for protecting your money, such as the
            following.
          </p>

            Simply put, you should use your common sense and take advantage of
            all security measures at your disposal when you gamble with crypto
            online. Don’t put yourself at any more risk than is necessary.

          <TextTitle title={"Keep Your Eyes Open for Special Offers"} />
          <p>
            Most crypto online gambling sites love it when their customers use
            Bitcoin, Ethereum, and similar options. This is because the
            transaction costs these sites incur are lower. As such, they often
            actively promote cryptocurrencies by adding cashback, bonuses, and
            other promos.
          </p>
          <p>
