            The rapid growth of Bitcoin has been nothing short of exceptional.
            There was very little publicity for this digital currency when it
            was launched less than ten years ago, but it’s subsequently become a
            genuine phenomenon. There is now widespread interest in Bitcoin, and
            it continues to go from strength to strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bitcoin was almost worthless at the outset. In what is believed to
            have been the first “real-world” Bitcoin transaction, 10,000 units
            of the currency were used to purchase two pizzas. The value of this
            cryptocurrency has increased exponentially since then, and 10,000
            units today are worth MILLIONS of dollars. Those who bought into the
            currency early made life-changing sums of money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although not yet considered a “mainstream” currency, it does have a
            number of practical uses. One of these is gambling. Bitcoin can be
            used for making deposits and withdrawals at many of the leading
            online gambling sites, and there are several advantages in doing so.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is that a lot of online gamblers don’t really understand
            Bitcoin. We’ve recently been inundated with queries about using
            Bitcoin for online gambling, and many of these queries have come
            from people who know virtually nothing about this digital currency.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why we’ve put together this comprehensive guide to Bitcoin
            and Bitcoin gambling. We’ve covered all the basics you need to know
            about this popular cryptocurrency, such as how it works and the
            technology behind it. We’ve also explained how to use it for your
            online betting and gaming. There’s plenty of additional information,
            too, including a look at Bitcoin investment and trading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Full details of what’s in this guide can be found below. We’ve split
            the page into the following sections, making it easy to find
            anything specific that you might be looking for.
          </p>
          <Title title={"Recommended Bitcoin Gambling Sites"} />
          <p>
            Of all the questions we get asked about Bitcoin, “Where can I gamble
            with Bitcoin?” is the one we hear most. So, it makes sense for us to
            start this guide by answering it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news is that you have plenty of options for gambling online
            with Bitcoin. As the currency has grown in popularity among online
            gamblers, more and more gambling sites have decided to accept
            Bitcoin as a way of depositing funds. Most of them allow withdrawals
            using the cryptocurrency, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important that you don’t use just ANY site, though. Some of the
            gambling sites that accept Bitcoin are genuinely high quality, but
            there are several that come nowhere near that standard. The
            following sites are our top picks at this moment in time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We consider these to be the best Bitcoin gambling sites for several
            reasons. First and foremost is the fact that we KNOW they can be
            trusted. They’re reputable operations that won’t rip you off or try
            to cheat you in any way. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of
            ALL gambling sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other factors that make these sites great include the range of
            gambling activities available, the bonuses and rewards on offer, and
            general user experience. They’re all sites that we regularly use
            ourselves, and we’re confident you’ll like them just as much as we
            do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Something we should point out here is that are effectively two
            different types of gambling sites accept this digital currency.
            These are as follows.
          </p>

          {/*   {/ leaveee /} */}
          <p>
            Please note that these are not “official” terms. We just think
            they’re the best way to describe the two different types. Hybrid
            sites accept Bitcoin along with other more traditional banking
            options, while Bitcoin-only sites (somewhat obviously!) accept
            Bitcoin only. Some may accept other cryptocurrencies too, though.
          </p>
          <p>
            We prefer the hybrid sites as a general rule. This is for two
            reasons. First, the hybrid sites tend to be the more established
            sites that have been operating for a while. Most Bitcoin-only sites
            are relative newcomers, so it’s harder to be sure that they’re
            trustworthy and likely to still be around in the years to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second reason is simply the convenience factor. While there are
            definite advantages to depositing and withdrawing using this
            cryptocurrency, it’s still nice to have the option of using other
            methods. There are many reasons why you may prefer to use Bitcoin on
            some occasions and alternatives on others.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not to say that we don’t like the Bitcoin-only sites at all.
            They have some clear benefits, too, so there’s a strong argument for
            having accounts at both types of sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve provided additional information on the two types of sites on
            the following page. We’ve also explained more about our
            recommendations and why we suggest them, and we’ve recommended the
            top sites in a range of more specific categories.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you’re already familiar with Bitcoin and how it works, there’s no
            reason why you shouldn’t jump straight in and sign up with one or
            more of our recommendations. If you’re something of a Bitcoin
            beginner, however, we suggest learning about the currency before you
            start using it to gamble with. The next section will teach you what
            you need to know.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Bitcoin Currency Explained"} />
          <p>
            There are all kinds of reasons for wanting to learn about Bitcoin.
            Some people are interested in using the currency to gamble with, as
            we’ve mentioned, while others want to explore the investment
            opportunities it presents. Some people are simply curious to find
            out what all the fuss is about.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of people don’t get much further than WANTING to learn about
            it. Despite having an interest, they find the whole subject of
            digital currency somewhat overwhelming. They hear unfamiliar words
            like “cryptocurrency” and “blockchain” and decide it’s all too much
            to take in.
          </p>
          <p>
            We understand this. Bitcoin is different from the traditional
            currencies that we’re all used to, and the technology and processes
            involved are far more complicated. But here’s the thing: the basics
            of Bitcoin are actually quite straightforward. And once you
            understand the basics, the more complex aspects start to make a lot
            more sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing that you should know about Bitcoin is that it’s
            classed as cryptocurrency. You’ll hear terms like “virtual currency”
            and “digital currency” associated with it, too, but cryptocurrency
            is the more accurate term.
          </p>

          {/*       {/ leave it /} */}
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency essentially has three defining features. The first is
            that it’s entirely digital. You don’t get Bitcoin notes or Bitcoin
            coins. Cryptocurrency is effectively a “virtual asset” that can be
            transferred between parties electronically.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second defining feature of cryptocurrency is that it uses
            cryptography (hence the name) to create new units and to store and
            verify transactions. We won’t get into the detail of cryptography
            itself, as that’s where things start to get complicated. In simple
            terms, though, it’s a form of encryption. You can read more about
            the subject here if you’re interested.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third defining feature of cryptocurrency is perhaps the one that
            makes it so appealing. Unlike traditional currency, cryptocurrency
            is not controlled by any bank, government, or other central
            authority. It has a limited supply, and its value is dictated solely
            by market forces. The absence of central control also means some
            transactions can be made completely anonymously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency of note, and it remains the
            most prominent, but there are actually several cryptocurrencies in
            circulation at the moment. There are new ones launched on a regular
            basis, too. Although many cryptocurrencies fail to gain much
            traction, some have established themselves as viable alternatives to
            Bitcoin.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a separate section on our site that’s dedicated to
            cryptocurrency in general, rather than Bitcoin specifically. You’ll
            find all kinds of useful information there, including a more
            detailed explanation of exactly what cryptocurrency is and how it
            works.
          </p>

          <Button>cryptocurrency guide</Button>
          <p>
            Most cryptocurrencies work in pretty much the same way. They are
            created electronically, usually as a reward to users for completing
            certain tasks. Bitcoin, for example, is created as a reward for
            solving complex mathematic functions and recording transactions of
            the currency onto a public ledger. This process is known as
            “mining.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Users must have a Bitcoin wallet to receive the currency they earn.
            A wallet is also required in order to buy Bitcoin, as it’s basically
            the only way to store the currency. The buying and selling of
            Bitcoin typically takes place on public exchanges, although
            transactions can also be made privately on a peer-to-peer basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don’t worry too much if this doesn’t make much sense to you right
            now. We’re just trying to give you a basic overview of what’s
            involved in this stage. We’ll shortly point you in the direction of
            some other pages in this guide that explain everything in more
            detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following graphic provides a neat summary of the basics we’ve
            just outlined.

            Are you ready to learn more now? Then you should check out the
            following pages. Combined with the information above, these will
            give you a solid understanding of this currency to build from.
          </p>

          {/*     {/ leave it /} */}

          <Title title={"Getting Started With Bitcoin"} />
          <p>
            The step from learning about Bitcoin to actually OWNING Bitcoin is a
            big one. It can be a daunting one, too, no matter how well you
            understand all the basics. But we’re here to help, and we’ll try to
            make the process of getting started as easy as possible for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, you’ll need to set up or purchase a Bitcoin wallet. As
            we mentioned earlier, this is the only way you’ll be able to store
            any currency you buy, mine, or receive from other sources. You have
            several options here, which we explain fully on the following page.
            We also provide some recommendations for which wallets to use.
          </p>
          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Bitcoin Wallets"} />
          </div>
          <p>
            Once you have your wallet, you’ll want some Bitcoin to put in it.
            There are three main ways for you to obtain the currency, and these
            are as follows.
          </p>
          {/*   {/ leave /} */}
          <p>Let’s take a look at what each of these options entails.</p>

          <Title title={"Mining Bitcoin"} />
          <p>
            Mining is the hardest way to obtain Bitcoin, especially if you do it
            on your own. It’s a complex process that requires significant
            computing power to be effective. You’ll have to invest money in
            expensive specialist equipment and time on setting that equipment
            up. It’s not really something we recommend for most people.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are, however, some alternatives to mining Bitcoin on your own.
            You can join mining pools, for example, where you work with others.
            Or you can use cloud mining services, where you basically pay to
            have the mining done remotely on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following article explains all about Bitcoin mining in more
            detail.
          </p>
          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Mining Bitcoin"} />
          </div>

          <Title title={"Buying Bitcoin"} />
          <p>
            Buying Bitcoin with traditional currency is the easiest and most
            straightforward way to start filling your digital currency wallet.
            It’s not entirely unlike swapping one traditional currency for
            another when you’re going overseas. There are just no banks or
            financial institutions involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s possible to purchase Bitcoin privately from someone you know,
            or from online marketplaces. Believe it or not, there are even
            specialist Bitcoin ATMs where you can buy the currency using cash.
            The most common method is to use exchanges, though. These are online
            platforms where you can typically trade any traditional currency for
            Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. You can also make trades between
            different cryptocurrencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two pages in this guide that will help you with buying
            Bitcoin. The first is a comprehensive article on all aspects of
            buying and selling the currency. The second explains how exchanges
            work in more detail and includes a list of ones we recommend using.
          </p>
          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Buying & Selling Bitcoin"} />
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Bitcoin Exchanges*"} />
          </div>

          <Title title={"Receiving Bitcoin as Payment"} />
          <p>
            As Bitcoin has grown in popularity, the currency is increasingly
            being used as a way to pay for goods or services. If you’re a seller
            of either of these, then you might want to consider accepting it.
            Especially if you’re selling goods or services online. It’s easy for
            your customers to make Bitcoin payments online, and it’s easy to set
            things up so payments go directly into your wallet.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, you’ve now learned a little about how to get ahold of some of
            this cryptocurrency. And we’re pretty sure we know what your next
            question is.
          </p>
          {/*   {/ leave /} */}
          <p>
            The simple answer to this question is “almost anything.” You can’t
            spend Bitcoin EVERYWHERE you can spend traditional currencies (yet),
            but there are certainly lots of places where you CAN spend it. Many
            online retailers accept Bitcoin as payment, including some major
            ones, and there all kinds of other places you can spend your digital
            currency, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve already mentioned that it can be used for online gambling, and
            for the purposes of investment and trading. They’re particularly
            common uses of Bitcoin, so we’ve dedicated whole sections of this
            guide to them. We’ve covered other uses on the following page.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Bitcoin & Bitcoin Gambling"} />
          <p>
            Although we cover a variety of subjects on GamblingSites.com, our
            website is ultimately (and somewhat obviously!) primarily focused on
            gambling-related topics. It’s only natural, then, that our Bitcoin
            guide includes plenty of information on using this currency to
            gamble with.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of Bitcoin for online gambling has increased dramatically in
            recent times. It wasn’t that long ago that there were only a couple
            of sites accepting digital currency, but that’s all changed now.
            With a growing number of gamblers choosing to use Bitcoin for their
            gambling transactions, sites have HAD to adopt the currency or risk
            losing customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bitcoin offers several advantages to online gamblers. There are some
            disadvantages, too, but for many, the pros outweigh the cons by
            quite some distance.
          </p>
          <Borderedbox>
            <p>Bitcoin is ESPECIALLY useful for gamblers in America.</p>
          </Borderedbox>
          <p>
            You might not understand why this is if you’re not from America, so
            let us explain. Online gambling is something of a challenge in the
            United States, thanks to a piece of legislation called the Unlawful
            Internet Gaming Enforcement Act (UIGEA). This was passed back in
            2006, and contrary to popular belief, it didn’t actually make online
            gambling illegal.
          </p>
          <p>
            What it did do, however, was make it illegal for banks and financial
            institutions to process online gambling transactions. As a result,
            many of the leading gambling sites pulled out of the US and stopped
            accepting American customers. This left American gamblers with much
            less choice of where to bet and play, and most of the sites they
            could use were facing challenges in processing deposits and
            withdrawals.
          </p>

            Most US-friendly gambling sites still face those challenges today.
            The best ones have found ways to overcome the problem to some
            extent, but they’re not always able to process transactions as
            quickly and effectively as they’d like.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you live in the United Kingdom or another region where online
            gambling is fully legalized and regulated, you’re probably used to
            instant deposits and fast withdrawals. Online gamblers in the US are
            not so lucky. Deposits can take a little while to be authorized, and
            withdrawals regularly take a few days or longer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bitcoin solves this problem. Because this currency is not regulated
            or controlled, it’s MUCH easier for gambling sites to process
            transactions. Deposits are usually more or less instant, and
            certainly faster and more reliable than other banking options.
            Withdrawals are often received by customers in a matter of hours,
            which is a huge improvement.
          </p>

            Most of the other advantages of gambling with Bitcoin have nothing
            to do where you live. So, regardless of your location, it’s worth
            looking into using this currency for your online gambling
            transactions. The following page explains all about the pros and
            cons and includes the information you need to get started.

          <p>
            In addition to the above page, we’ve also written individual guides
            to using Bitcoin for each of the most popular forms of gambling.
            These include further recommendations for good sites to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why have we recommended MORE sites? It’s simple, really. The sites
            we listed at the top of this page are the ones we consider the best
            “all-rounders.” They’re good for all the different types of
            gambling, so they’re good options if you enjoy multiple gambling
            activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some sites, however, are particularly good for specific types of
            gambling. These aren’t always great at everything, though. For
            example, one of our favorite sports betting sites has a terrible
            selection of casino games. We’d never recommend that as a good
            all-rounder, but it features in many of our lists of recommended
            sports betting sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that these pages aren’t JUST about recommending sites.
            They contain all kinds of other useful information, too.

            The next page in this section lists some of the most popular
            gambling games you can play using Bitcoin. This list features
            several traditional casino games, as these are available at most
            Bitcoin gambling sites. There are also some additional games that
            you don’t typically find at standard gambling sites and online
            casinos
          </p>

          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Popular Bitcoin Gambling Games*"} />
          </div>
          <p>
            There’s a reason why Bitcoin gambling sites usually have games that
            are not available elsewhere. Because of the way Bitcoin works, it’s
            possible for these sites to provide what are known as “provably
            fair” games. Here’s a quick explanation of what this means.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provable fairness refers to the technology used by bitcoin casino
            and gambling sites to verify the outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This allows players to confirm that the outcomes were true and fair
            without any adjustments or manipulations by the gambling sites
            between when the bet was placed and when the outcome was revealed.
          </p>
          <p>Source – https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Provable_fairness</p>
          <p>
            Now, if you play at reputable and legitimate online casinos, then
            you’re going to be playing fair games anyway. They don’t need to
            prove fairness in the same way, as they’re subject to third-party
            audits due to the regulatory requirements they’re required to adhere
            to.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there are plenty of gamblers who are cynical about the
            fairness of online casino games. We know a few people ourselves who
            are absolutely convinced that all online casinos are fixed and
            designed to rip you off. This is completely irrational, as casinos
            already have the advantage of the house edge without needing to do
            anything unethical.
          </p>
          <p>
            There have been some cases of crooked online casinos rigging their
            games, but such casinos are very much in the minority. Nonetheless,
            there are probably always going to be gamblers who don’t even trust
            the reputable operations. Provably fair gambling would appeal to
            them, as they can check for themselves that the games are performing
            as they should. This is another major advantage of Bitcoin gambling,
            and something we explain in more detail in the following page.

            Some of the earliest investors in the first true cryptocurrency paid
            just a few cents for each Bitcoin. If you had made a $100 investment
            in 2010, you could have cashed out for around $20 million in 2017.
            Yes, you read that right. You could have turned $100 into $20
            million in just seven years.
          </p>
          <p>Sickening, right?</p>
          <p>
            No one knows how many people have become millionaires through
            investing in Bitcoin, but we’re pretty sure there’s been more than a
            few. There are even reports of people making BILLIONS from their
            investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you get too excited and start investing your life savings, we
            have some bad news. Buying Bitcoin now is NOT some easy way to get
            rich. That ship has sailed, unfortunately. Many believe that the
            currency will continue to grow in value, but any future growth is
            unlikely to be as explosive as it has been. There’s every chance
            that Bitcoin could go DOWN in value too – possibly significantly.
          </p>
          <Borderedbox>
            <p>The price of bitcoin is EXTREMELY volatile.</p>
          </Borderedbox>
          <p>
            Although the general trend of Bitcoin’s value has been upward, there
            have been some wild fluctuations over the years. And there will
            probably be many more to come, too. This is not an investment for
            the faint of heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s still an investment worth considering, though. There are risks
            involved for sure, but as with any currency or financial instrument,
            there are opportunities for making money by buying and selling at
            the right times.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are the right times? Well, that’s the difficult bit. It’s all
            very well saying you need to buy low and sell high, but with this
            digital currency, it’s hard to know what the price is going to be in
            the next day or two. Never mind in the next week or month.
          </p>

            “Hard” is not the same as “impossible,” of course. And although we
            can’t tell you exactly when to buy and when to sell, we can help you
            to make informed decisions for yourself. Our article on Bitcoin
            trading and investment explains everything that’s involved and
            offers some useful advice for maximizing the opportunities for
            profit. We’ve also compiled a list of the best brokers and trading
            platforms you can use.
