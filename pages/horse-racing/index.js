            This guide also contains information and advice relating to online
            horse racing betting, including our recommendations for the best
            gambling sites to use. There’s some general information on the sport

          <p>
            There are effectively two parts to this first section of our guide.
            One part serves as an introduction to the sport of horse racing, as
            it’s advisable to have at least a reasonable understanding of the
            sport before starting to bet on it. We’ve written about the various
            forms of racing that take place around the world and we also cover
            the different breeds of racehorses. In addition to that, we’ve
            explained all the jargon that’s used in the sport.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part of this section is all about the betting side of
            things. There’s an article that explains how to bet on horse racing
            and another that goes over all the different bets and wagers you can
            place. There are also articles featuring some strategy and advice
            that are essential reading if you want to stand a chance of making
            money.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend that you start with this section if you know very
            little, or nothing at all, about horse racing and how to bet on it.
            The following summarizes everything it covers.

            It’s also worth mentioning at this point that betting on horse
            racing is similar in many ways to betting on any other sport.
            There’s a lot of information and advice in our sports betting guide
            that can also apply to horse racing betting, so you may also want to
            take a look through this.

            Although you can have plenty of fun gambling on horse races while
            knowing only the basics, it’s never a bad idea to expand your
            knowledge of the sport as much as you can. You’ll certainly want to
            do this if you have any ambitions of making money from your betting.
            To be successful when betting on horse racing, you almost need to be
            an expert on the sport.

          <p>
            In the following sections of our guide, we provide some general
            information on the sport that’s both interesting and useful to know.
            We’ve focused primarily on three regions where horse racing is
            particularly popular (the US, the UK, and Australia), but we’ve
            covered several other parts of the world as well.

            One of the reasons why betting on horse racing is so popular is that
            you don’t actually need to know very much to get involved. There’s a
            lot to learn if you want to take things seriously and give yourself
            a good chance of making money in the long run, but it’s really
            simple to get started. Plenty of people enjoy just placing the
            occasional bet on big races without knowing much about the sport at
            all, which is perfectly fine.
          </p>
          <p>
            This guide will help you whether you plan to bet on racing regularly
            or just every now and then for recreation. However, there’s a really
            important point that we want to leave you with, as this is something
            that you absolutely must understand before you even think about
            betting on horse racing.

            HORSE RACING BETTING INVOLVES RISK This might seem like an extremely
            obvious point to make, but it’s one that we think we should mention
            regardless. Horse racing betting is a form of gambling and, like any
            form of gambling, there’s risk involved. Bettors must be prepared to
            lose every wager they place, even if they truly believe they have
            picked the winner. You can make a profit through betting on horse
            racing if you’re good enough, but there will always be some level of
            risk involved. Even the world’s biggest expert on the sport isn’t
            guaranteed to win every bet they place. In the same way that a
            football match isn’t always won by the best team, a horse race isn’t
            always won by the best horse. In any case, there’s usually some
            degree of prejudice concerning which the best horse might be in any
            particular race.
          </Borderedbox>

          <p>
            We don’t bring this point up to turn you away from the idea of
            betting on horse racing but we want to make sure you understand the
            risks involved before you get started. It’s vital that you always
            gamble responsibly and risk only money that you are prepared to
            lose.
