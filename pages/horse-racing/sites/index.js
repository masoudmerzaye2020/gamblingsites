          <p>
            Horse racing and betting have always gone hand in hand. Watching
            races such as the Kentucky Derby, Grand National, or Melbourne Cup
            is exciting, but it’s even better when you have real money wagers at
            stake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Betting on horse racing couldn’t be any easier than it is today,
            thanks to the internet and the abundance of horse racing betting
            sites. Online horse betting is very simple, and offers many
            advantages over the alternatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important to use the right racebooks, though, which is why we
            encourage you to stick to the best horse racing betting sites as per
            our recommendations.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to online betting for real money, we believe that
            choosing the right site is among the most important decisions you’ll
            make.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason why is because the internet is still the Wild West in
            many ways. There are a few “bad actors,” operators who don’t follow
            the rules and take advantage of unsuspecting and vulnerable bettors.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could accidentally join one of these sites and not know until
            it’s too late. But chances are, this won’t happen because you’re
            here, on this page, where we don’t recommend anything but the best
            sites for betting on horse racing online.
          </p>

            <Mainbullet link={""} linkdesc={"20Bet"} />

          />

          <p>
            One of the things that makes our rankings of the best horse betting
            sites unique is that we routinely update it to make sure it’s as
            accurate as possible at any given time. We don’t just pick a list of
            sites at the start of the year and then forget about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of our reasoning for this is that safety is our utmost concern.
            It’s the first thing we look for when we review any type of online
            gambling site, and if any currently recommended site shows signs of
            dropping its standards then we’ll pull it from our rankings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s now take a minute to talk about how we come up with our list
            of recommended horse racing betting sites.
          </p>

          <Title title={"About Our Recommended Horse Betting Sites"} />
          <p>
            We get it, you’re skeptical. You want to know where our
            recommendations come from. And you want to know why you should trust
            us. We don’t blame you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The racebooks we recommend are truly top-notch if you want to bet on
            horses online. However, instead of just stating how great our
            recommendations are, we’ll show you how we come up with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, fancy features such as live streaming or promotions like
            free bets are worthless if you join a betting site that’s unsafe,
            untrustworthy, and inattentive.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why we don’t recommend sites like that. Here’s how we filter
            out the legit sites from the shady ones.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Check for a License"} />
          <p>Obtaining a license is a small hurdle for an operator to jump.</p>
          <p>
            However, if they’re issued a license, it means they paid a fee,
            applied, and were vetted by a gambling commission. It also means
            they’re operating legally in the jurisdiction in which they’re
            based. This is clearly a good indication that they’re safe to use.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Read Customer Feedback"} />
          <p>
            We scour the internet looking for customer feedback for each online
            sportsbook we recommend.
          </p>
          <p>
            We check to see if a betting sites pays their customers (quickly).
            It’s important that they uphold their terms and don’t retroactively
            change them. And we want to know if the site has ever resorted to
            shady tactics to keep their customers’ money on-site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best online horse racing betting sites do none of these things.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Submit a Support Ticket"} />
          <p>
            It’s inevitable that, during our reviews, we come up with questions
            about a site’s promotions, betting options, and features. And if we
            do, even with our vast experience in online gambling, you likely
            will, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why we send at least one support ticket to every betting
            site we review. Once we hit send, we’re looking to see how fast the
            bookmaker’s support team responds, how helpful they are, and how
            many emails it takes to solve our problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s the general process for ensuring that every site we recommend
            is safe, trustworthy, and attentive. It has consistently helped us
            identify the horse racing betting sites we’d trust with our
            hard-earned money.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t all we do, though. This part of our process only ensures
            that an online bookmaker or sportsbook is a safe option regardless
            of what you like to bet on. It doesn’t mean it’s a good site for
            horse racing bettors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever we review a site for a specific audience, such as those
            looking for the best places to bet on horse racing online, it’s
            important that we double-check that our recommendations are a good
            fit.
          </p>
          <p>
            We look for the following qualities whenever we review a horse
            racing betting website.
          </p>

          {/* leave the list */}

          <p>
            The more of these boxes a site can check off, the more eager we are
            to recommend them to our horse racing bettors.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also look for other details, such as banking options and limits,
            other gambling options such as blackjack or poker, and whether they
            offer mobile apps. These factors matter, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            But so long as they tick the boxes in this section, we have no doubt
            that we can recommend them to our readers.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this is how you know you’re joining one of the top horse racing
            betting sites online when you join any of the recommendations on
            this page.
          </p>

          <Title title={"More Top-Rated Horse Racing Betting Sites"} />
          <p>
            Our main recommendations are for the best of the best horse racing
            betting sites. These sites are great for anyone with a general
            interest in gambling on horse races online
          </p>
          <p>
            But we also recommend the best horse racing betting sites for people
            who have a specific need or interest. You might want to go this
            route to find the betting site that is the right fit for you if you
            have particular preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, we recommend horse racing betting sites for people
            living in specific countries or regions.
          </p>

          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"United States"} />
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"United Kingdom"} />
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Australia"} />
          </div>

          <p>
            You can also join a betting site that specializes in specific horse
            races. When you join a site that we recommend for a particular race,
            you can bet your bankroll that the site will have the best odds,
            betting opportunities, and offers for that race.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an awesome opportunity. If you think about it, these
            prestigious races are held all over the world. Are you able to
            travel to Europe, the United States, or Australia just to watch and
            bet on a race?
          </p>
          <p>Probably not. That’s not in the cards for most people.</p>
          <p>
            But what you can do is join one of our recommended horse betting
            websites and place your bets there.
          </p>

          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Kentucky Derby"} />
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Preakness Stakes"} />
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Belmont Stakes"} />
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Breeders Cup"} />
          </div>

          <p>
            Now, what if you love to bet on horse races but you also like to bet
            on other sports, such as basketball, baseball, MMA, or golf?
          </p>
          <p>
            In that case, we recommend that you don’t join a dedicated horse
            racing site. You should join a general sports betting site that
            excels in areas such as bonuses and payouts instead.
          </p>

          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">

              link={""}

            You may also want to check out our list of the best sports betting
            sites. This page covers ALL the sites we rank and recommend.

          <Title
            title={"Getting Started With Online Horse Racing Betting          "}
          />
          <p>
            If you’ve never placed a bet online before, getting started can be
            intimidating. There are so many steps to take before you make your
            first bet. None of the steps are difficult, but it can feel like a
            lot when you see them all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Joining one of the best horse racing betting sites is your first
            step. The good news is that step isn’t hard, seeing as how we did
            all the work reviewing and ranking all the quality options we could
            find.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is just the beginning, though. There are a few other things
            you’ll want to think about before you place your first real money
            wager. Let’s look at those now.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Make Your Deposit"} />
          <p>
            Want to place real money bets? You’ll need to have real money in
            your account. To do that, you’ll have to make a deposit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most sportsbooks accept an assortment of banking methods. The
            following are a few of the most common options you’ll have.
          </p>

          <div>
            <Mainbullet
              link={""}
              title={

              }
            />
            <Mainbullet
              link={""}
              title={

              }
            />
            <Mainbullet
              link={""}

              }
            />
            <Mainbullet
              link={""}
              title={
                "Bank Wire - Ship a wire directly from your bank to the sportsbooks bank"
              }
            />
            <Mainbullet
              link={""}
              title={

            />
            <Mainbullet

              }
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            The options you have will depend on where you live and what the
            gambling site accepts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making a deposit isn’t hard, especially if you’ve done any shopping
            online. You’ll go to the cashier, choose your banking method, and
            follow the instructions. All this usually entails is you inputting
            your banking info and the amount you want to deposit.
          </p>
          <p>That’s all there is to it!</p>
          <p>
            If you run into any troubles, every online bookmaker and sportsbook
            we recommend is more than happy to help you make your deposit. Just
            ship them a message, and they’ll get you sorted.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"App or Desktop?"} />
          <p>
            Another decision you’ll have to make is whether you want to place
            your bets on your mobile device using an app or via the desktop app.
          </p>
          <p>
            There isn’t a right or wrong way to go. It’s a matter of preference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a mobile app is convenient. You can take it anywhere you have
            internet access. And most sportsbook apps are as robust as their
            desktop app.
          </p>

          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Top Horse Racing Betting Apps"} />
          </div>

          <p>
            However, mobile devices are smaller. If you struggle to read smaller
            text or you don’t want to stream a race on a 9” screen, then using
            the bookmaker’s desktop app might be a better choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, the desktop app will have more features, too. This is
            becoming less and less the case, though, as the mobile side of the
            industry continues to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way, you’ll have the same deposit options, access to bets,
            and the same promotions to choose from. Of course, there’s no rule
            saying that you can’t use both options.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Your Horse Betting Bankroll          "} />
          <p>
            Bankroll management is a loaded topic, so we’ll only cover a few of
            the basics here. How much money you have on hand to bet will depend
            on a few factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            For one thing, what’s the amount of money you can dedicate to
            betting? Your win rate also matters. Losing bettors will need more
            money than winners will. The types and bet sizes matter, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally speaking, we like to err on the side of caution and have
            more money. A good rule of thumb is to keep at least 100x your
            betting unit on hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            A unit is the amount you wager. For example, if you make $1 bets,
            your betting unit is $1. This means you should keep at least $100 in
            your bankroll. If you routinely make $10 bets, then you should keep
            $1,000 on hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            From here, we recommend increasing your bankroll if you like to make
            risky bets or the occasional big bet. Both types of bets increase
            the risk to your bankroll, either due to the odds of you winning or
            variance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beginners can get a lot of experience depositing $100 to $500,
            assuming you use proper bankroll management and an analytical
            approach to sports betting.
          </p>

            You’ll also want to think about the races you want to bet on. This
            will impact a lot, including the horse racing betting sites you
            should join, the wagers you can make, how much you can bet, and
            loads more.

            These are some of the most popular and prestigious races you can bet
            on. However, most sportsbooks take action on other less popular
            races, too.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"What Bets Do You Want to Make?          "} />
          <p>
            The bets you want to make is another important consideration. This
            decision will impact where you bet and the races you can bet on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each bet has a different amount of risk, which means your decisions
            will also impact your bankroll. So, don’t take this decision
            lightly!
          </p>
          <p>
            The following are the most common types of bets you can make. Terms
            vary slightly depending on where you live.
          </p>

          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Straight Bet"} />
          <p>
            The same as the Daily Double, except that you’re choosing the winner
            for three to six straight races.
          </p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Win"} />
          <p>You’re betting on the horse you think will win the race.</p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Place"} />
          <p>This is a bet on the horse you think will take second.</p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Show"} />
          <p>Bet on the horse you think will take third.</p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Exotic"} />
          <p>
            There are two types of exotic bets, horizontal and vertical.
            Horizontal bets require you to pick the winner of anywhere from two
            to six straight races. Vertical bets are choosing the exact order of
            the top two, three, or four horses.
          </p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Daily Double"} />
          <p>Choose the winner of two back-to-back races.</p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Pick 3,4,5,6"} />
          <p>
            The same as the Daily Double, except that you’re choosing the winner
            for three to six straight races.
          </p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Exacta"} />
          <p>
            Pick the win and place in that specific order for any particular
            race.
          </p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Trifecta"} />
          <p>
            Pick the top three horses that will cross the finish line in the
            exact order that they cross the finish line to win.
          </p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} title={"Superfecta"} />
          <p>
            This is the same as a trifecta, except that you’re betting on four
            horses and the exact order that they win.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend beginners make straight, win, place, or show bets.
            Though the payouts aren’t nearly as large as the riskier bets, your
            chances of winning are significantly higher. With a solid strategy,
            you’ll win more often and can get by on a smaller bankroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s nothing wrong with making a riskier bet, however. Just be
            prepared for losing these bets more than you win them and having a
            bankroll large enough to sustain those losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are some of the important considerations you’ll want to think
            about before you make your first bet. There are other things that
            matter too, such as betting odds, the types of horse races you can
            bet on, and even the lingo that’s used in horse racing and betting.

            these areas and then some. Check it out if you’re newer to horse

          <p>
            Horse races are prestigious events and used to be reserved for
            “fancy” people.
          </p>
          <p>
            A couple decades ago, you’d have to get dressed up and attend the
            races in person if you wanted to bet on them. Or visit one of Las
            Vegas’ sportsbooks, or a bookmaking shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            But times have changed for the better. Nowadays, you can bet on the
            ponies from anywhere in the world where you can access the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can make bets for as little as $1, win thousands on the back of
            a single wager, and claim deposit bonuses worth hundreds and
            thousands of dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can bet on the world’s largest and most prestigious races …and
            you don’t have to leave the comfort of your own home to do it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that sounds good to you, then the first step is to join one of
            the top-rated horse racing betting sites. Don’t get this wrong,
            though, as you and your bankroll could be in for a world of hurt.
