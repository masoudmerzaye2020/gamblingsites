            <p>We’ve ranked the best real money football betting sites for 2022, so you can safely bet football online with absolute confidence. They’re listed below, so check out these football betting sites if you’re ready to get in on the action.</p>
                <p>We want to be absolutely certain that we steer people in the right direction for their online football betting. That’s why we conduct a lot of in-depth research and extensive testing when ranking the best football betting sites for you to choose from.</p>
                <p>There are several factors that we take into consideration when compiling our rankings, which we explain all about further down this page. You’ll find out exactly why we rate these top football betting sites so highly and why we’re confident that they can be trusted with your real money deposits.</p>
                <p>Let’s start with another look at our recommended football betting sites and what makes them so special.</p>

                <p>American football has become popular all over the world. It’s still most popular within the US, though, where it’s the country’s number one spectator sport and also attracts the most betting interest.</p>
                <p>With that in mind, and the fact that gambling laws are so complicated in the region, it makes sense for our focus to be on online football betting from the US.</p>
                <p>There is general confusion about the legalities of online sports betting in the US. This is compounded by the fact each state has been allowed to handle the regulation of sports betting since PASPA got repealed in 2018. However, although we’re not legal experts, it is clear that there’s no law preventing Americans from gambling on football online.</p>
                <p>It’s especially important for Americans to use sites that they know are reputable, though. There are some sites out there that are most definitely not. The top football betting sites for US bettors are listed above and they can all be trusted.</p>
                <p>We will use the rest of this page to look at some of the reasons you should use online football betting websites and the wagering options available. We’ve also offered some expert tips to help you win money in your football gambling exploits.</p>
                
                
                
                <Title title={'Ranking the Best Real Money Football Betting Sites'}/>
                <p>When it comes to ranking real money football betting sites, or any type of gambling site for that matter, we have to bear in mind that people have different preferences and requirements. The “best” site for one person may not necessarily be the best for someone else.</p>
                <p>That’s why we consider a wide range of factors when evaluating sites. We want to recommend the sites that offer the best all-around service and perform well in all the most relevant areas. There is, however, one thing that we value above all else. A site MUST be demonstrably safe and trustworthy. It should be licensed and operating legally in the jurisdiction in which it is based. And, of course, actually payout all real money winnings!</p>
                <p>Every single one of our recommended football betting sites meets these vital criteria.</p>
                
                <Wideimage src={'/image/Safe-Trusted-Football-Betting-Sites.jpg'}/>
                
                <p>The benefits of using legal football betting sites that are subject to regulation by reputable authorities should be obvious. The last thing you want to worry about when betting on football online is whether a site is going to disappear with your money or not pay you your winnings.</p>
                <p>Once we’ve established that a site is definitely a legit operation that is safe to use, we start assessing all the other factors that make for a top football betting site. Here are some examples.</p>
                <TextTitle title={'Deposit and Withdrawal Methods'}/>
                <p>The best online betting sites go the extra mile to make it easy for their users to deposit and withdraw funds. There are multiple convenient deposit methods offered at all of the sites we recommend, so you’ll definitely be able to fund your account with no problems.</p>
                <p>Withdrawals are just as easy, and the turnaround times are surprisingly rapid. This is especially true when you use Bitcoin to fund your account. Since there is no middleman, the transactions can be facilitated in minutes at the best football betting websites.</p>





                <TextTitle title={'Customer Service'}/>
                <p>When your hard-earned money is going to be deposited at an online betting site, you want to be able to speak to a real human being when you have any questions or concerns. The top football betting sites take this dynamic to heart, and as a response, they provide world-class service on every level.</p>
                <p>The telephone agents are knowledgeable and fully engaged, and they are empowered to resolve most situations on the spot. Most customer service centers are open around the clock, so you will always be able to get help when you need it. Email customer service is available as well, along with real-time chat.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'The telephone agents are knowledgeable and fully engaged, and they are empowered to resolve most situations on the spot.

                <p>Betting football online can be time-sensitive, and when depositing your own money, you want to be able to initiate transactions with no obstacles. Things happen, and this is understandable, but quality real money online sportsbooks have to keep downtime to an absolute minimum, and they do just that.</p>
                <p>We have all seen websites that have the eye-candy graphics, but you’re not visiting them to see the highlight of a web designer’s portfolio. Ease of navigation is what it’s all about for the sports bettor, and our preferred sites are definitely no-nonsense in that regard.</p>

                <p>Every online sportsbook on our list is custom crafted to easily adapt to the mobile environment. You can place your wagers from anywhere as long as you can access an internet connection.</p>
                <p>This is just a small selection of factors we use when ranking the best football betting sites. Here are a few other important considerations.</p>

                <Title title={'Why Use Online Football Betting Sites?'}/>
                <p>There are brick-and-mortar sports betting parlors in some parts of the United States, and they are as common as convenience stores in many parts of Europe. If you have access to a physical sportsbook, why would you want to bet football online?</p>
                
                <Wideimage src={'/image/Why-Bet-On-Football-Online.jpg'}/>
                <p>This is a good question, and we have the answers.</p>
                <TextTitle title={'All the Fun, None of the Hassles'}/>
                <p>When you embrace the online sports betting option, you never have to deal with unpleasant circumstances.</p>
                <p>There are no traffic or parking woes, and you don’t have to rush to the window to make your bets before kickoff. You can sit back and watch your action with your friends at your favorite watering hole, or you can simply chill at home and take in the games from your easy chair.</p>
                <p>There are no long lines, no surly clerks, and no need to go back to the sportsbook to collect your winnings.</p>
                <Borderedbox>Why should you subject yourself to any hassles at all when it’s completely unnecessary? Simply make your sports bets online and do it the smart way.</Borderedbox>
                <TextTitle title={'Bonuses and Promotions'}/>
                <p>In addition to the simple fact that it’s much more convenient to bet football on the internet, there is another advantage that can directly affect your overall chances of making money.</p>
                <p>When you walk into a traditional sportsbook for the first time, you’re not going to be handed any free money, and of course, you wouldn’t expect something for nothing. The lay of the land is entirely different when betting online.</p>
                <p>Our top-ranked football betting sites offer a sports betting sign-up bonus to new customers, and they can be significant depending on the amount of your deposit. After that, there are ongoing promotions that can add some more oomph to your bankroll.</p>
                <p>Nothing is stopping you from opening accounts at more than one betting site, and this is highly encouraged. When you have multiple online gambling accounts, you can claim multiple welcome bonuses, and ongoing promos can be monitored as time goes on. There are also handicapping benefits to having accounts on multiple football betting websites.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Shopping for Best Odds and Lines'}/>
                <p>Odds are adjusted based on the way the money is moving, and each site is going to see a different ebb and flow. As a result, the odds on a particular game can vary from site to site.</p>
                <p>You can shop for odds at all the different online sportsbooks that you frequent before you make your bet at the one that is offering you the best odds and lines.</p>

                <Borderedbox>Over the long haul, a half-point or a point here or there can make a noticeable difference in your success rate.</Borderedbox>
                <p>Shopping for the best odds and lines is one of the most important strategies for successful football betting, and it’s so much easier when placing your football wagers online.</p>


                <Title title={'NFL and College Football Betting'}/>
                <p>The best football betting sites emphasize both the National Football League and NCAA college football. Regardless of the specific flavor you prefer, the highly trusted sites that we recommend will exceed your expectations.</p>
                <p>However, we have also compiled separate rankings for the best sites for betting on the NFL and the best sites for betting on college football.</p>
                
                <div className='flex flex-wrap justify-center'>
                <Bluebutton link={''} title={'NFT Bettin Sites'}/>

                </div>

                <p>Let’s take a look at the wagering options that are typically available at the online sportsbooks we recommend, starting with the most popular football bets.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Types of NFL Bets'}/>
                <div>
                    <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Point spreads'}/>
                    <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Totals'}/>
                    <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Moneyline'}/>

                    <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Teasers and pleasers'}/>
                    <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Halftime wagers and live betting'}/>
                    <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Futures'}/>
                    <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Propositions'}/>
                </div>

                <p>These are just some of the many different types of bets that can be made on football games, and our preferred football betting websites offer all of them.</p>
                <p>The most popular football wager that is available at all online sports betting sites is the point spread bet. You typically have to lay -110 on either side rather than even money because the bookmaker has to make a profit somehow. This is an example of the way that it will look on the board.</p>

                                    <div className='bg-[#21558f] rounded-r-lg py-4 h-full w-3/12 text-yellow-300 text-xl'>-110</div>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Perceived talent differences and home-field advantages are accounted for when the point spread is established at the football betting sites. This evens out the matchups, and it enables the book to use the balanced -110 odds (or close) on both sides.</p>
                <p>You can alternately choose to place a bet on the moneyline. If you go this route, the team that you choose has to win the game outright, and the score doesn’t matter. However, the odds that you have to lay on the favorite and the underdog can be decidedly different.</p>
                <p>For example, a seven-point favorite might be -330 on the moneyline, with the dog priced at +250. As the talent difference increases, you have to lay more lumber on the chalk, so a 10-point fave could be -450, with a +325 price on the underdog.</p>
                <p>Another type of bet that typically starts out at -110 on both possibilities is the totals wager. The sportsbook will post an estimate of the total number of points that will be scored by both teams. You can bet the over or the under. Here’s an example.</p>
                
                <div className='my-4'>
                    <div className='bg-[#1a2d37] rounded-lg max-w-[720px] mx-auto text-center p-4'>

                </div>

                <p>We stated that the bet “starts out” at -110 on both because the books will sometimes adjust these numbers slightly before changing the total if one side takes more action than the other.</p>
                <p>A parlay wager is a bet on more than one interest on the same ticket. One very common parlay would include a side and the total on the same game, but you can pick and choose any betting interests.</p>
                <p>Parlays with numerous teams can deliver some robust returns, but it’s tough to pick a single winner, let alone seven or eight.</p>
                <Borderedbox>Big multi-team parlays are kind of like lottery tickets with a little bit of skill mixed in, but there is nothing wrong with taking a shot in the dark every now and then.</Borderedbox>
                <p>A teaser is similar to a parlay except that you get extra points, but the payouts are lower than they are for parlays because you have the advantage of these “training wheels.” Standard extra points would be either 6, 6.5, 7, or 7.5 points. The more points you take, the less you get if you win.</p>
                <p>Pleasers can be described as the opposite of teasers because you surrender points, but the payouts are considerably bigger than parlay returns.</p>
                <p>Halftime wagering is good because it’s a drag to make a bet and be pretty much out of action early on if you were very wrong. You have a way to redeem yourself because online sportsbooks post odds at halftime on the sides and the totals. This can be a second chance, but it can also be a way to hedge your original bet.</p>
                <p>Live betting is another option that involves placing wagers after the game has started, but they can be posted at any time during the game. This allows you to make sophisticated wagers based on your analysis of what you have seen on the field, and it’s another type of wager that can be used to hedge.</p>
                <p>The top-ranked football betting sites take plenty of real money bets on NFL futures. A futures bet is a wager on a team to win their division, their conference, or the Super Bowl. Big market teams often take more than their fair share of action, so you can usually find overlays in the futures betting pools. Check out the latest odds for NFL futures on the following page.</p>

                </div>
                <p>A proposition wager, or prop, is a bet on a particular focused aspect of a game or a player’s individual performance. You may see a prop on the over/under on total field goals made by both teams, the total interceptions thrown, or whether or not there will be a special teams touchdown scored.</p>
                <p>For players, they may post a line on total yards gained by a top running back in a game or the passing TDs for a quarterback. Online prop wagers are not offered for every game every Sunday; they are usually limited to games that are the sole focus within a time slot, like Sunday and Monday night frays.</p>
                <p>One game that you’ll find has tons of props available is the Super Bowl. Some Super Bowl betting sites will offer more than 100 different props for the NFL’s biggest game.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'NCAA College Football Betting'}/>
                <p>Thursdays, Sundays, and Mondays are not the only fun days for football betting online. College football is very well represented on the online football betting sites, and the menu is stuffed full of dozens of contests every Saturday during the season.</p>
                <p>College football betting options mirror that of the NFL, but you will not see propositions posted as often. You can make prop bets for the college football playoffs, and some of the best football sites will dangle propositions for the other big bowl games.</p>

                <p>In 2020, the XFL made a comeback with a new season. Unfortunately, the league’s comeback season was interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the XFL will return in 2023. This league offers additional football betting opportunities, during a time when there are no NFL or college football games.</p>

                </p>
                <TextTitle title={'Make Handicapping Your Hobby'}/>
                <p>If you are like most people, you invariably find yourself looking for something to pass the time a few times a day. When you dive headfirst into online football gambling as an ongoing activity, you will never be at a loss because there is always work to be done.</p>
                <p>After a given week is history, it’s time to hit the books and do your homework for the following one. If you like to bet on college and pro football, there are countless matchups to examine, and there are sites on the internet that provide in-depth statistical information. For example, you can get extensive NFL player stats right from the competition’s official website.</p>
                <p>You can systematically go through every game to identify weaknesses in the line if you have the time and the inclination. It’s also possible to streamline your handicapping efforts, and the freedom to take it as far as you want to is a beautiful thing.</p>
                <p>Scouring the stats as you form opinions and then using that knowledge to guide your wagers can be a satisfying way to spend some time.</p>


                <Borderedbox>When everything comes together on game day, the fruits of your labor are exceedingly sweet.</Borderedbox>
                <TextTitle title={'Practice Good Bankroll Management'}/>
                <p>Handicapping can be fun if you look at it right, and all sports fans find it easy to form opinions. For many people, bankroll management is the hard part, but it’s equally important.</p>
                <p>Professional gamblers will set aside a certain amount of money that they keep completely separate from their personal funds. This is not unlike the way that an independent restaurant owner would look at money in the cash register as opposed to the wad that he carries around in his pocket.</p>
                <p>You should set a comfortable staking plan based on the size of your bankroll. Experts will typically recommend about 3% for beginning players. If you avoid wild fluctuations, you will come out on top (or at least break even) if you pick more winners than losers over the course of a season.</p>
                <TextTitle title={'Get That Bonus Cash'}/>
                <p>We want to reemphasize the value of the welcome bonuses that you can receive at the top-ranked football betting sites. After you sign up on a particular site and get your first infusion of free cash, you may start to feel comfortable and forget about all of the other options that are out there.</p>
                <p>This is understandable, but you don’t want to leave any money on the table. Go get the bonuses that are sitting there waiting for you and put them to good use. Going forward, visit all of the sites on an ongoing basis so that you can pounce on promotions when they are offered, and look for referral rewards as well.</p>
                <p>The internet sportsbooks below are well known for the generous bonuses and promotions that they provide for their players. Check them out and do the deed if free money appeals to you.
