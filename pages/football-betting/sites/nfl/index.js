            Online NFL betting has become increasingly popular over the last few
            years. As a result, you can now bet on NFL football at almost any
            real money gambling site. However, this doesn’t mean that you just
            join the first site you find.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve examined many online sportsbooks and bookmakers to compile our
            list of the best online betting sites for NFL, and there is a reason
            why our list is reasonably short. Quite simply, only a few sites
            meet our high standards in terms of the all-round package they
            provide.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to bet on the NFL online, and have the best possible
            experience, then our recommendations are the way to go. Based on our
            extensive research, there are no better options for online NFL
            gambling.
          </p>
          <Wideimage src={"/image/"} />
          <Title title={"How We Rank NFL Betting Sites"} />
          <p>
            Let’s delve into some of the key criteria that’s important to us
            when choosing which NFL betting sites we recommend to our readers.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Absolute Legitimacy"} />
          <p>
            You are naturally going to take pause before you deposit your
            hard-earned money into an online sportsbook account. How do you know
            that you can trust the people behind the site? After all, anyone can
            put up a website, and there may or may not be any oversight to
            maintain legitimacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            These concerns are totally valid, but you can set them aside when
            you stick to any NFL sports betting site that has earned a place on
            our list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though it can seem as though website operators exist in a gray area
            without any guidelines, this is not the case at all.
          </p>
          {/* onlkjlkj;lkj;lkj;l */}
          <p>
            Major economic powers and smaller jurisdictions alike license and
            regulate the internet sports betting industry. Reputable licensing
            bodies go to great lengths to make sure that applicants are fully
            qualified before they issue permits, so it is wise to stick to sites
            that are licensed in these jurisdictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we are putting our rankings together, we evaluate the licenses
            that are held by the contenders, and we consider reputational
            factors. Longevity is an element that we weigh heavily, and we visit
            forums that are frequented by serious players that share feedback
            about NFL betting sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            The websites that we recommend are deeply invested because licensing
            fees and operational costs are considerable. They are in it for the
            long haul, and they take their responsibilities to their players
            very seriously.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Deposits and Withdrawals"} />
          <p>
            The best online sportsbooks that highlight NFL betting make it easy
            for players to deposit funds into their accounts. Common methods
            include Visa, MasterCard, ACH transfers, wire transfers, and
            Bitcoin, just to name a handful. High rollers are welcome, and there
            are modest minimum deposit requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the exception of the credit cards, gift cards, and debit cards,
            the withdrawal methods are the same as the deposit options, and you
            can add in phone transfers, E-checks, and checks by mail.
          </p>
          {/*   jbooidujfpjk;lkdajf;lakdsj;flkds */}
          adfadsfadsfadsf
          <p>
            If you have the need for speed when it comes to the transactions,
            you may want to use Bitcoin to fund your account. Deposits and
            withdrawals can be facilitated in a matter of minutes on some sites
            because there are no intermediaries, and payout processing will
            usually be free within certain frequency limits.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Commitment to World-Class Service"} />
          <p>
            A site can act with integrity, and they may make it easy to
            facilitate transactions, but what about the customer experience?
            This is always going to be a resistance point for online businesses
            because consumers have to wonder if they will be able to get in
            touch with someone when they need help.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NFL betting sites that have gotten our green light are sensitive
            to this dynamic. They provide top-notch customer service over the
            phone, through email, and via real-time chat. They offer wide
            windows of availability, and agents can resolve most issues quickly
            and efficiently.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Solid Design and Infrastructure"} />
          <p>
            Website design is another important element that we examined closely
            when we were compiling our list of the top NFL betting sites for
            2022. The websites that you will visit if you follow our lead make
            it very easy for you to get around from the start.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no learning curve, and there is no confusion. This is key
            when you are going to be putting your cash on the line, especially
            when you are in a hurry to get your action in before you are shut
            out.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site operators make huge investments in the infrastructure, and
            this includes high-tech, state-of-the-art encryption technology to
            keep sensitive information safe. Plus, while some circumstances
            cannot be controlled, you can play on these sites for years and
            never run into any downtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, these are just a few factors that we consider when ranking NFL
            gambling sites. There are many others that also influence how highly
            we rate sites. We won’t weigh you down in too much of the detail,
            though. Just rest assured that if you’re looking to bet on NFL
            football online, our recommendations are genuinely the best options
            around.
          </p>
          <Title title={"Is it Legal to Bet on the NFL in the US?"} />
          <div>
            {/* leave image */}
            <p>
              Many sports bettors in the US are confused by the current
              situation relating to the legalities of betting on sports online.
              This is not surprising, as things have changed regularly over the
              years and there’s still a distinct lack of clarity about exactly
              what’s legal and what’s not. It’s not illegal to place a bet on an
              NFL game through an online NFL betting site.
            </p>
            <p>
              We won’t get into too much detail here, as you can read more about
              the whole situation in our page dedicated to the best US sports
              betting sites. What we will say, however, is that you don’t need
              to worry about the legality of placing wagers online. There are
              two different types of sites though, known as regulated and
              offshore. There is a lot of catch up for the regulated market to
              make in order to properly compete with the others.
            </p>
            <p>
              The offshore sports betting sites have far more experience with
              online betting and are still regulated, just not in the US.
              Instead, they’re based outside the United States, but they operate
              legally and are licensed within their respective jurisdictions.
            </p>

          <Title title={"Benefits of Online NFL Betting"} />
          <Wideimage src={"/image/"} />
          <p>
            The top NFL betting websites offer a host of benefits for players to
            enjoy. If you have never placed sports bets online before, you will
            undoubtedly be quite impressed when you take the plunge for the
            first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some of the main advantages of doing your NFL betting
            online.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Your Personal Mobile Betting Site"} />
          <p>
            Even if you are fortunate enough to have a brick-and-mortar sports
            betting parlor in your community, the convenience that is afforded
            by the online experience is off the chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Geography is simply not a factor because you can access NFL betting
            sites from anywhere, as long as there is an internet connection
            available.
          </p>
          {/*  jlkjads;lkfja;dslkf a;ldskjf */}
          ja;lkfja;dskf;Days
          <p>
            You can make spur-of-the-moment decisions when you have your own
            sportsbook in your pocket wherever you may roam, and this is another
            advantage when you’re betting on the NFL. When it comes time to
            watch your action, you can hunker down at home or head down to the
            local sports bar and bet on NFL games as you see fit.+
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Infusions of Bonus Cash"} />
          <p>
            One of the best things about the safe and legitimate NFL betting
            sites is the bonus money that is offered. You get a sign-up bonus
            right off the bat, and it is typically tied to the amount of the
            initial deposit. Maximum welcome bonuses will typically be anywhere
            from $250 to $1000.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of sites will offer an initial risk-free bet as an additional
            shot in the arm. The promotions that are offered on each respective
            site vary, but it is not uncommon to see reload bonuses as well to
            keep the free money coming for existing players.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loyalty can be a good thing when it comes to business relationships,
            but it has its place. If you check out all of the NFL football
            betting sites that we recommend, you will see that there are
            different sign-up bonuses offered. To take full advantage of these
            opportunities, you could open accounts at all the sites to reap the
            rewards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bonuses for NFL online betting vary from season to season, and
            they’re something we monitor when updating our rankings. We’ve also
            provided some additional information about the best NFL betting
            bonuses for 2020 on our blog.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"You Can Shop for Odds"} />
          <p>
            Back in the day on the well-trodden concrete of the Las Vegas Strip,
            grizzled denizens of the sports betting scene would go from property
            to property shopping for odds. They wanted to make sure that they
            got the most favorable numbers that were available for the plays
            that they wanted to make.
          </p>
          {/* djfa;lkdsjf;lkaj;lkajdsf;lkdsa */}
          <p>
            When you open accounts at several sites to snag the bonuses, you can
            easily visit all of them before you place your wagers. The odds can
            vary, so you will be sure that you are getting maximum value if you
            shop around for odds.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Betting History at Your Fingertips"} />
          <p>
            If you are going to be making NFL bets on a consistent basis, unless
            you don’t mind losing your shirt in the long run, you have to take
            bankroll management seriously. We are not going to get into strategy
            here, but you should wager within your limits and track your
            progress so that you know where you stand.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be difficult to do in the realm of brick-and-mortar
            sportsbooks when you are reaching into your pocket to place your
            bets in cash. The situation is entirely different when you bet
            online at the top NFL betting sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the info is stored in the cloud, so in a real sense, a free
            accounting feature is included when you open your account. This is
            useful in a general sense when you are evaluating your handicapping
            success, and the records are easily available if you ever have to
            discuss a transaction issue with a site.

            online.
          </p>
          <Title title={"Online NFL Betting Options"} />
          <p>
            There are a number of different types of wagers that can be made at
            the leading NFL websites that we have separated from the pack. You
            can keep it immediate and simple if you choose to do so, and on the
            other side of the spectrum, there are long-term and exotic betting
            possibilities.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Straight Bets Against the Point Spread"} />
          <p>
            The standard tried-and-true NFL football bet is the straight bet
            against the point spread. You can place these wagers at the NFL
            betting websites, and the standard odds are -110 on either side.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have to lay this extra 10% as the vigorish. If you are not
            familiar with the term, the sportsbooks do not want to take gambles,
            and they have to make money somehow. If an equal number of bets are
            taken on each side at -110, they will make a profit regardless of
            the outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is interesting because a lot of people are under the impression
            that the bookies are trying to beat the players, but this is really
            not the case. All they want to do is balance the action and take
            equal wagers on both sides. Bettors are actually playing against
            other players that back the opposite side.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Moneyline Bets"} />
          <p>
            Another type of bet that you can make on sides to win games is the
            moneyline wager. With this type of action, you have to pick the
            winner outright. This sounds easy enough, but the odds complicate
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the point spread bet with -110 odds on both sides, the talent
            differences are accounted for by the variations in the moneylines.
            To explain through a simple example, let’s say that the Lions are
            visiting Chicago, and the Bears are nine-point favorites.
          </p>
          <p>
            There can be slight differences depending on site policies, but as a
            rule of thumb, the Bears would go off at odds of -400, and the
            return on Detroit would be +300. It is not a very appealing prospect
            to lay $400 to win $100, but some people are okay with the
            risk/reward equation.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other side of the coin, a moneyline bet on the plus-side can
            provide some extraordinary value at times if you can isolate a live
            dog.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Totals Wagering"} />
          <p>
            The pro football betting websites post totals on all of the games. A
            total can be described as an estimate of the combined number of
            points that will be scored by both squads in a given contest. You
            can bet the over or the under, and the odds are balanced at -110 on
            either option.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Parlay Bets"} />
          <p>
            The best NFL betting sites take a lot of parlay bets because many
            people want to put out a little to make a lot. A parlay is a wager
            with multiple different betting interests on the same ticket. The
            more teams on a parlay, the more you win if every single betting
            interest on your ticket is a winner.
          </p>
          <p>
            To see the potential payouts for parlays with different numbers of
            teams, check out this page.
          </p>
          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Strategins for Football Parlayers"} />
          </div>
          <TextTitle title={"NFL Teaser Bets"} />
          <p>
            Another type of bet that involves putting multiple different plays
            on the same ticket is a teaser. The difference between a teaser and
            a parlay is the fact that you get additional points in your favor
            when you bet a teaser. The standard increments for teasers are 6,
            6.5, 7, or 7.5 points.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can tease sides, and you can tease totals at the online
            sportsbooks that offer this option. We also have a page on this
            website that explains how to bet teasers, complete with a payout
            chart, that you can check out to learn more.
          </p>
          <p>
            A cousin to the teaser bet is the pleaser. It is based on the same
            concept since it is a multi-interest wager, but it works in the
            reverse manner. Instead of getting a more favorable betting line,
            you surrender points.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that a six-point favorite on a seven-point pleaser would
            become a 13-point chalk for the purposes of your bet.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s tough enough to pick a winner against the normal point spread,
            so this wager is quite difficult. That’s the bad news, but the good
            news is that the payouts are nice and juicy. For example, if you can
            hit a two-team pleaser, you get paid at odds of +600.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Halftime Bets and Live Wagering"} />
          <p>
            The internet sportsbooks post halftime lines on sides and totals for
            NFL games.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a complete reset starting out at zero to zero for the second
            half, regardless of the scoring that was done during the first half.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Online NFL Futures Betting"} />
          <p>
            Every NFL football fan should make at least one futures bet every
            year. If you are not familiar with them, a futures bet is a wager on
            a team to win a title. There are odds to win division championships,
            conference crowns, and the Super Bowl.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be hard-pressed to find more value for a single bet because
            you have action for as long as your team stays in the hunt. There
            can be some pretty nice odds floated on promising teams that fly
            under the radar going into a season, and this is a potentially
            lucrative avenue that should be explored.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Proposition Bets"} />
          <p>
            Proposition bets are offered on some NFL games at the top betting
            sites for 2022. These are wagers on certain “games within games.”
            For example, you may be able to bet on a particular running back
            gaining over or under a specified number of yards or the number of
            field goals kicked in a game.
          </p>
          <p>
            These wagers add a dimension to your action, and a prop bet can keep
            you alive even if your primary wager on a side or total is not doing
            very well.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Bet the Super Bowl Online"} />
          <p>
            The culmination of the NFL season is of course when the Super Bowl
            is played. When it comes to proposition bets, there is a small phone
            book full of possibilities for the big game, and some of the
            propositions offered at the NFL betting sites are quite bizarre.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have an over/under on the length of the performance of the
            national anthem, the color that will be worn by the halftime act,
            the number of commercials that will be shown, and many other oddball
            props.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s not uncommon to see promotions that are offered around Super
            Bowl Sunday, so it’s always one of the most exciting days of the
            year at any of these top Super Bowl betting sites.
