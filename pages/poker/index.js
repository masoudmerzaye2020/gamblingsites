            Poker is one of the best known card games in existence. Early
            versions of poker were first played in the 19th century, and the
            game has certainly evolved over the years. Playing poker is now a
            very popular pastime among people all over the world. It can be
            played simply for fun, like most card games, but the real appeal is
            in playing for real money stakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many variations of poker, each one having its own set of
            rules and strategies. Learning how to play the games is relatively
            easy, but mastering them and learning how to win is much harder. It
            takes time and effort to become a successful poker player, and not
            everyone is cut out for the job.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it’s a lot easier to test your skills at the game than it
            used to be, thanks to the advent of online poker. These days it’s
            possible to play over the internet, for real money, and against real
            players. You can play any time of the night or day without having to
            leave the comfort of your own home.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve produced this poker guide to teach players everything they
            could possibly ever want to know about the game of poker, including
            playing online. We’ll help you get started if you’ve never played
            before and we can help you win too. We explain all the important
            aspects to how online poker works and also make recommendations for
            the best places to play.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page details everything our guide has to offer, and we would
            suggest reading through it all. If you’re looking for something in
            particular, though, you can head straight to the relevant section.

          <Title title={"Understanding the Risks of Playing Poker"} />
          <p>
            The very fact that you are reading this page suggests that you are
            thinking about starting to play poker, or are possibly even playing
            the game already. Either way, it’s very important to understand that
            there are risks involved when it comes to playing poker. There’s
            always a chance that you’ll lose money during a game and it’s
            important to be fully prepared for that reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of people choose to play poker because it’s gambling against
            other players rather than against a casino or bookmaker. Casinos
            always have the advantage in casino games due to the house edge and
            bookmakers always have the advantage because they get to set the
            odds for the wagers they take. Poker is more of a level playing
            field, with all players essentially having the same chance to win.
            That doesn’t mean it’s easy to win though, and in fact, it can be
            quite the opposite.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Most Poker Players Are Overall Losers"} />

          <p>
            That’s right, most people that play poker lose money. You’re sadly
            mistaken if you think that it’s possible to just learn the rules of
            the game and then sit down and take money from all the other
            players. It’s far more likely that they’ll be taking money from you,
            particularly when you first start playing. You might win money some
            of the time, but the likelihood is that you’ll lose more often than
            not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people accept that they’ll lose money and choose to play poker
            purely as a form of entertainment. These players tend to view poker
            in much the same way as they do casino games; a fun activity which
            offers a chance to win some money. They try to win if they can, but
            they don’t mind losing as long as they enjoy themselves. They
            basically just want to gamble and hope they get lucky every now and
            then.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s absolutely nothing wrong with approaching poker in this way.
            Plenty of people enjoy playing in the casino even when they know
            they’re probably going to lose, so there’s no reason why people
            can’t do the same with poker. If you just want to have some fun,
            then you should go for it but please make sure that you set a budget
            and gamble responsibly.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"You Don’t Have To Be A Loser"} />
          <p>
            The key difference between poker and casino games is that you don’t
            have to accept the fact that you’re going to lose money. It’s up to
            you how you approach the game. You can just play for the fun of it
            if you want, knowing that it’ll probably cost you money, or you can
            try to do something to increase your chances of winning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you win or lose is, to some extent at least, within your
            control. There’s nothing you can do to guarantee that you’ll win
            every time, but you can certainly put the odds in your favor. If
            you’re prepared to spend the necessary time and effort to learn
            everything there is to know about the game and all the strategy
            involved, then there’s nothing stopping you from making money from
            poker.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note, though, that even the best poker players in the world
            have losing streaks. It doesn’t matter how good you become, the
            element of luck in the game means that there’s always a chance of
            losing to players who aren’t as good. Setting a budget and gambling
            responsibly is still important, even as a skilled player.
          </p>
          <p>
            How you choose to approach poker is entirely up to you. That’s part
            of the beauty of the game. It appeals to those just wanting to have
            some fun and it also gives those who want to play for a profit an
            opportunity to do so. No matter what approach you take, you’ll be
            sure to find the rest of this poker guide very useful.

          <p>
            If you’re completely new to poker, then our section on the basics of
            poker is the best place to start. It explains a number of things
            that you should really understand before playing, and it can help
            you decide whether poker is the game for you. We look at the pros
            and cons of this form of gambling, plus we have included a list of
            do’s and don’ts that are very helpful if you do choose to play.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are articles on each of the following topics too. Although
            these articles are all written with the beginner in mind, an
            experienced player may even find them interesting.

          <Title title={"Poker Variants, Formats & Structures"} />
          <p>
            Poker is fundamentally a simple game. The different variants,
            formats, and structures do make things a little more complicated
            though. You don’t need to learn how to play each and every variant
            there is, as you can choose to stick to just one if you want.
            However, there are some things that are essential to learn before
            you start playing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, you’ll need to understand the two main formats of the
            game. These formats are cash games and tournaments, and we’ve
            explained each one of them in detail in the following two articles.
          </p>
          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Cash Games"} />
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Tournament"} />
          </div>

          <p>
            You also need to understand all of the different betting structures
            and limits, such as no limit and fixed limit. We’ve explain all of
            these in the following article.
          </p>
          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Betting Structures & Limits"} />
          </div>
          <p>
            Somewhat obviously, you also need to learn the rules for any variant
            that you choose to play. You can find the rules for a number of
            variants in our poker game guides. We’ve listed the most popular of
            our guides below and these also contain a range of other related
            information. We recommend starting with Texas Hold’em, as this is
            the most widely played game, but it’s ultimately up to you.

            Due to online poker’s increasing popularity, there are a myriad of
            websites available that offer poker. Some of these are excellent
            places to play, while some of them don’t quite hit the same
            standards. You obviously want to play at the better sites, but it’s
            not that easy to determine which ones are good and which ones are
            not. You don’t need to worry about this though, as we are here to
