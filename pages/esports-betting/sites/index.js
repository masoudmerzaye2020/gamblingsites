            If we had a dollar for every question we’ve ever been asked about
            sports betting we’d be rich. We’d be even richer if we had a dollar
            for every question we’ve ever been asked about ESPORTS betting
            though. The amount of questions that come in about this relatively
            new form of sports betting is unfathomable. We’re actually surprised
            this influx of questions hasn’t caused our email server to crash
            yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the questions we get asked the most is “Where can I bet on
            esports?” That’s an easy one to answer. Many online betting sites
            cover esports these days, so you are blessed with plenty of options.
            That’s probably why we’re also regularly asked, “What are the best
            esports betting sites?” Here’s your answer to that one.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re looking for somewhere to bet on esports RIGHT NOW, you
            should go ahead and sign up with one of these sites. They all come
            highly recommended, and you won’t be disappointed with the service
            you receive. We’re 100% confident that these are the best esports
            betting sites at this moment in time.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we think about it, the volume of esports related questions is
            not that surprising. With “traditional” sports betting, most people
            understand what the sports they’re wagering on are all about. They
            know how football is played, for example, or the rules of tennis.
          </p>
          <p>
            With esports betting, however, a lot of people don’t have the first
            clue what esports actually are. Even if they do, they typically only
            know the basics. So OF COURSE, they have questions. Not just about
            the betting, but about the sport itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The media coverage of esports has steadily increased over the years,
            which is why more and more people have developed an interest in it.
            Since esports are still up and coming, though, the information on it
            is somewhat limited. That’s why people come to us for answers, and
            we’re happy to help.
          </p>
          <p>

            On this page we’ve answered a selection of frequently asked
            questions about ONLINE esports betting. This includes an explanation
            of why we recommend the sites shown above. Here’s a full list of the
            questions we answer here.
          </p>

          {/*  {/ leave the questions list /} */}

          <TextTitle title={"Why do you recommend these sites?"} />
          <p>
            Because they’re the best around! That’s the simple answer, but we
            realize you probably want more information than that. So here’s a
            list of some of the factors we consider when deciding which sites to
            recommend to our readers.
          </p>

          <div>
            <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Licensing and regulation"} />
            <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"History and reputation"} />
            <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Ease of use"} />

            <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Banking options"} />
            <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Speed of payouts"} />
          </div>

          <p>
            There are other factors we consider too, but these are the main
            ones. Why? Because they have the biggest impact on your overall
            betting experience. Our goal in recommending sites to our readers is
            to ensure that they have a safe and enjoyable experience. So, we
            obviously need to make sure that the sites we recommend provide
            exactly that.Let’s take a further look at the above factors and
            explain why each one is important.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Licensing and regulation"} />
          <p>
            We only ever recommend sites that are properly licensed and subject
            to formal regulation. Although this is no guarantee of overall
            quality, it does at least indicate that a site is safe to use. Sites
            that go through the process of getting an online betting license
            from a reputable licensing authority usually intend to operate
            legitimately and ethically. There are SOME exceptions unfortunately,
            but they’re very rare.Sites that DON’T have a license are the real
            problem. Having no license means that they can operate however they
            choose, with no governing body to answer to. They’re not regulated
            in any way, so they’re free to rip off their customers without
            facing any real consequences. And, sadly, that’s precisely what most
            unlicensed sites do. These sites need to be avoided at all costs.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"History and reputation"} />
          <p>
            We always check a site’s history and reputation as part of our
            evaluation process for ranking betting sites. This is another good
            way to determine whether they’re safe to use.If a site has a track
            record of treating their customers badly or a reputation for
            unethical behavior, then they clearly are NOT safe to use. As a
            result, they have no chance of being recommended by us.If a site has
            a good track record however, and/or a positive reputation, then we
            ARE going to consider them. A good track record doesn’t guarantee a
            spot in our rankings, but it does get a site on our shortlist.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Ease of use"} />
          <p>
            At this stage of the 21st century, there is no excuse for ANY
            website to be hard to use. Things were different when the internet
            was still relatively new and betting sites were just hitting the
            market. We understand why early betting sites weren’t exactly what
            we would consider to be “user-friendly.” Things have changed
            drastically over the years though and now we expect much more out of
            the sites we use.We always mark a site down if the ease of use is
            not up to the required standard. This is for two reasons. First, it
            gives the impression that they don’t actually care about their
            customers that much. Second, it makes for a frustrating experience.
            It drives us crazy when it’s far harder to place a wager than it
            needs to be!
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Coverage of contests"} />
          <p>
            Since the popularity of esports has exploded, LOTS of different
            competitions started taking place. You’ll probably want to bet on
            most of them if you take your esports betting seriously. At the very
            least, you’ll want to have the option to. It can be pretty annoying
            if you go to a site to check the odds for an upcoming contest, only
            to find that the site isn’t taking wagers for that contest.We get
            that some betting sites aren’t fully into esports betting yet, and
            we understand why they don’t cover every single contest that’s
            taking place. We wouldn’t criticize them for that. But we’re not
            going to recommend them either. For a site to be among the best for
            esports betting, it HAS to offer good coverage: not necessarily
            EVERY contest, but at least the major ones.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Banking options"} />
          <p>
            We like to see a plenty of options for making deposits and
            withdrawals, as it’s important that customers have choice. Some
            people like to use credit or debit cards, while others don’t. Some
            people like to use e-wallets, and some prefer to do direct bank
            wires.The best sites offer all those options and more. Plus, they go
            out of their way to make the process for depositing and withdrawing
            as painless as possible.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Speed of payouts"} />
          <p>
            All gambling sites should pay their customers in a timely fashion.
            This is one of THE most important factors we look at when ranking
            gambling sites in any category. If we win, we should be able to
            expect our money within a reasonable timeframe. There’s no reason
            why anyone should be asked to wait more than a couple of days.Any of
            the sites on our list don’t mess around when it comes to paying
            their customers. If you win, you’ll get your money. And you’ll get
            it without having to wait too long.
          </p>

          {/* {/ leave the related question /} */}

          <TextTitle title={"Why should I bet on Esports online?"} />
          <p>
            Betting online is the easiest and most convenient way to place your
            esports wagers. Not to mention, it presents an opportunity to earn
            extra bonuses and rewards too. Once you take all these advantages
            into account, this question answers itself really.There’s also the
            fact that betting online might be your ONLY option. It almost
            certainly is unless you live in the United Kingdom or Nevada, or are
            willing to travel to these places every time you want to place a
            wager.We know that some (but not all) bookmaking shops in the UK
            take esports wagers, but we don’t believe that’s the case in any
            other countries right now. The only other land-based options
            available are the casino sportsbooks in Nevada. As of right now,
            that option is still very limited.Nevada sportsbooks have to apply
            to their regulators for EACH event they want to take wagers on. Most
            sportsbook aren’t doing that for many contests, if any at all.
            Believe it or not, it actually took until nearly the end of 2016
            before the first esports wagers were placed in Nevada. That’s
            incredible really, as people have been placing esports wagers online
            since way before then.
          </p>
          {/* {/ leave the related question /} */}

          <TextTitle title={"Why don’t ALL betting sites cover esports?"} />
          <p>
            Good question! It’s hard to know for sure really, especially when
            considering how popular esports betting has become. Possible reasons
            include the following.
          </p>
          <div>
            <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Lack of resources"} />
            <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Uncertainty about the industry"} />
            <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Legal issues"} />
          </div>

          <p>
            A lack of resources is an unlikely reason for the big sites not to
            get involved with esports betting. They’re typically owned by huge
            companies that have plenty of resources to call upon, so they can
            easily spend the money they need to add esports to the markets they
            offer. They can also afford to bring in the experts they need to
            price up those markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The smaller sites don’t necessarily have that luxury though. Many of
            them operate on very small margins, and some don’t make much profit
            at all. The cost of adding esports to their betting markets may not
            seem worth it to them at the moment. It’s not as easy as throwing up
            some odds and lines and then suddenly making a profit. This is
            something they really should take time to consider.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some sites are perhaps just unsure about whether the esports
            industry is going to continue to grow. We could understand this a
            couple of years ago, but it seems certain that esports are here to
            stay now. They’re firmly in the mainstream, and the industry is
            widely expected to get better and better. So any site that’s holding
            back, for this reason, is probably making a mistake in our opinion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Legal issues we can understand. If a site is operating in a region
            where the legal status of esports betting is unclear, it’s natural
            that they might not want to get involved. This is definitely a
            legitimate reason for some sites not to offer esports betting just
            yet, but it hopefully won’t be for much longer. With the rate that
            the industry is growing, we’d like to think that lawmakers around
            the world will take notice soon.
          </p>

            {" "}
            Maybe that’s being a little optimistic though!
          </Borderedbox>

          <TextTitle title={"What esports contests can I bet on online?"} />
          <p>
            This varies at different sites. As we mentioned earlier, they don’t
            all offer the same coverage. The better sites do tend to at least
            cover all the major contests though. Here’s a list of the
            tournaments and leagues that you’ll find at most of the leading
            sites.

            This depends on two things. First, it depends on which site you’re
            using. This is because the available betting options vary from one
            place to another. Second, it depends on which contest or game you’re
            betting on. Some wagers are only available for specific contests or
            games.
          </p>
          <p>
            One wager that you’ll always be able to place is the match winner
            wager. This is where you simply bet on which team or player will win
            a specific match. It’s available at all esports betting sites, and
            for all contests.

          <p>
            Yes. You absolutely CAN. Will you though? Well that’s a different
            question entirely. It depends on how much you know about esports,
            and how much effort you’re willing to put in to your betting.

            We believe that betting on esports will only get harder in the
            future, as the bookmakers and betting sites will become more and
            more knowledgeable about the various different games and contests.
            At the moment, their knowledge is somewhat limited. They’re
            certainly not as knowledgeable about esports as they are about the
            traditional sports, which means it’s definitely possible to take
            them on and win.
