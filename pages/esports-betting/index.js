          <p>Betting on esports is a BIG thing right now. This (relatively) new type of betting got off to a slow start, but it has gained a lot of traction over the last couple of years. The growth has been so explosive that it’s been estimated that the global esports betting market will be worth nearly $30 billion by the year 2020.</p>
          <p>That’s a massive figure, especially when you consider that esports are still “under the radar” to some extent. The esports fanbase is huge these days, but it’s nowhere near as big as the fanbases for traditional sports such as soccer, football and tennis. Most people outside of those types of fanbases don’t have any idea what esports are all about. They certainly don’t know anything about betting on them.

</p>
          <p>So then, what are esports? And how does esports betting work?

</p>
          <p>You’ll find the answers to these questions (and more) in this comprehensive guide to esports betting. It’s been carefully compiled by our team of experts to help ANYONE with an interest in wagering on esports. There’s a section dedicated to explaining all about esports, and another one that covers how the betting works.</p>
          <p>There’s also some basic betting tips for beginners, along with some more advanced strategy advice. We’ve recommended the best esports betting sites, too, and there’s a section for all the latest news as well as details of upcoming events.</p>
          <Sitescards/>
          <p>We can definitely help you to have a lot of fun with this form of betting, and our advice may even help you to make some money. You can read through the page for more details of what’s included, or use these links to go straight to what you’re looking for.</p>
          <Title title={'All About Esports'}/>
          <p>This section of our esports betting guide is for those of you who are completely new to esports, and where we explain all about this sport genre and what’s involved. Let’s start with a quick overview of what exactly esports are.</p>
          <p>The term esports is short for electronic sports, and it refers to competitive video gaming. So, we’re basically talking about people playing video games against each other in a competition. This is nothing new in itself of course, as it’s been happening in people’s homes ever since the first home computers and gaming consoles came out.</p>
          <Squareimage src={'/image/esportsbetting/playing-video-games.png'} desc={'Millions of people all over the world enjoy playing their favorite video games against friends and family.'}/>
          <p>There was a time when the ONLY way to play video games against “real life” opponents was to sit in front of the same machine. These days, however, we can also play games over the internet. This means we can play against someone from anywhere in the world while sitting at home.</p>
          <p>According to reports, more than ONE BILLION people take part in video gaming in one form or another. This is an amazing statistic, and shows just how popular video gaming has become. Not all of these gamers play against other players of course, as some people still enjoy solo gaming, but there’s no doubt that playing against real life opponents is preferred by many.

</p>
          <Borderedbox>
            <p>Most of these gamers are what we call “casual gamers.”
</p>
            </Borderedbox>
            <p>Casual gamers tend to play video games solely for fun. Many of them enter online tournaments and play in organized contests, but they’re ultimately playing for the fun of it. Although these casual and informal contests are still technically classified as esports, the term is typically used to refer to the professional scene.</p>
            <p>Yes, there really is a professional video gaming scene. This might surprise you if you are new to esports, but it’s 100% true, and it’s a MAJOR scene too. If you’re a gamer yourself, then you’ll know that casual gaming can be very competitive, but professional esports are on a whole other level. Some of the biggest contests see teams and players competing for millions of dollars in prize money.</p>
            <Squareimage src={'/image/esportsbetting/live-esports-contest.png'} desc={'Professional esports contests are often played out in front of live audiences in stadiums and arenas.'}/>
            <p>These contests don’t JUST attract live audiences, they are also watched by millions more fans worldwide via online streaming services such as YouTube and Twitch.tv. Even the big TV networks have got in on the act, with broadcasters including ESPN showing esports contests on their channels.</p>
            <p>So, like we said, the professional esports scene is a pretty big deal. We’ll discuss it in much greater detail in the following article. This is a must read if you want to truly understand what esports are all about.</p>
            <div>

            </div>
            <p>The above article covers all the important aspects of esports that you need to know. There are a few ESPECIALLY important aspects that we’ve covered in even more detail on other pages. These are as follows:</p>

            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Esports games'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Esports tournaments and leagues'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Esports teams and players'}/>
            <p>Before you start betting on esports, it’s absolutely VITAL that you have a proper understanding of at least some of the video games that are played. There’s no way you’ll be able to make good betting decisions if you don’t. It’s not necessary to be a genuine expert, but you certainly need to understand how the games are played and some of the strategies involved.</p>
            <p>Although there are dozens of different esports games, the majority of professional contests are played using just a few popular titles. Here’s a list of the ones that are featured most often.</p>
            
            <TextTitle title={'Popular Esports Games'}/>
            <div>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Battlefield'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Call of Duty'}/>

              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'FIFA Football/Soccer'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Halo'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Heroes of the Storm'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'League of Legends'}/>

              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'World of Tanks'}/>
            </div>

            <p>It’s equally important that you understand the structure and format of any esports contests you plan to bet on. Again, this helps with making good betting decisions. There are literally hundreds of tournament and leagues held around the world, but it’s probably best just to focus on the biggest ones to start. Here’s a list of the highest profile esports contests at this moment in time:</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Major Esports Tournaments & Leagues'}/>
            <div>
              <Mainbullet link={''} linkdesc={'The International Dota2 Championships'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'ELEAGUE'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Capcom Pro Tour'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Call of Duty Championship'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'eGames'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Evolution Championship Series'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Major League Gaming'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Intel Extreme Masters'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Battle.net World Championship Series'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Halo World Championships'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'League of Legends World Championships'}/>
              <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'World Electronic Sports Games'}/>
              
            </div>
            <p>Please see the following page for more information on these contests (and others too).</p>
            <div>
              <Bluebutton link={''} title={'Major Esports Tournaments & Leagues'}/>
            </div>
            <p>You also need to learn about the players and teams that take part in esports contests, which should be obvious, really. Would you bet on a football game between two teams you know nothing about? How about on a tennis match between players you’ve never heard of? We’d like to think that you wouldn’t, and you shouldn’t bet on an esports contest without knowing all about the participants either.</p>
            <p>The following page features details of the esports teams and players that are currently the best around. Please note that we keep this page as up to date as often as we can, but we recommend doing your own additional research as you go along, too. Things can change VERY rapidly on the esports scene.
