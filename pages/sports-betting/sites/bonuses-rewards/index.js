      <Header>Best Sports Betting Sites With Bonuses</Header>
      <Section>
        <Container>
          <p>There are many reasons why we love to bet on sports online. One of the top ones is that you can claim online betting promotions like welcome bonuses, free bets, and rebates.

</p>
          <p>Every online sportsbook worth joining runs deals like these, and we’ve got all the details you need on this page. To start with, here are the top sports betting sites for bonuses and rewards in 2022.

</p>
          <p>These are the best online sports betting sites to join if you’re interested in claiming a variety of betting promos.

</p>
          <p>However, if you want to claim a specific type of betting bonus, you’ll want to check out the rest of this page. You’ll learn about all the different sportsbook offers you can claim online and any bonus codes you might need.

</p>

          {/* leave the overview */}

          <Title title={'Top Sports Betting Promotions in 2022'}/>
          <p>Every online sportsbook runs betting promotions. You can claim sign-up bonuses, free bets, rebates, and other deals at every betting site (or app) that you join.

</p>
          <p>But not every betting offer is worth your time. Some offers are better than others. Some deals give you more money, have lower rollovers, and better terms and conditions.

</p>
          <p>This section is where we list the best betting promotions the internet has to offer and the online sports betting sites where you’ll find them.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Welcome Bonuses at Sports Betting Sites'}/>
          <p>Most of the top sports betting sites offer a “welcome” or “sign-up” bonus for new customers. Bonuses are a great way to feel a betting site out, test their software, and freeroll some bets.

</p>
          <p>The best US betting sites are typically especially generous in this regard. Here are the online sportsbooks offering the best betting sign-up offers for American bettors, along with their current main welcome bonus.

</p>
          {/* leave the table */}
          <p>Note that these online betting sites with bonuses can and do change their offers quite regularly. We try to provide the latest information, though.

</p>
          {/* leave the list */}
          <p>Few, if any real money betting sites with bonuses can tick every single box above. But the more boxes they can tick, the better their betting offers and the more inclined you should be to register an account and claim them.

</p>
          <p>Here are some of the best bonus betting sites for outside the US.

</p>

          {/* leave the boxes */}
          <p>We haven’t listed any details of the sports gambling bonuses available at these sites, as the offers depend on where you live. An online bettor in Canada, for example, will get a different deal to an online bettor in the UK.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Latest Online Betting Offers and Deals'}/>
          <p>You can find details of all the latest bonuses and promotions available at a range of top-rated gambling sites on our blog. This includes a monthly round-up of the best offers for sports betting and other forms of real money gambling.

</p>

          <Bluebutton link={''} title={''}/>
          <p>We recommend keeping an eye on our blog for details of the latest betting offers, especially around the time of big sports events.

</p>
          <p>Major events, such as the Super Bowl, will often see online bookmakers and sportsbooks ramp up their bonuses or run special deals and contests.</p>
          <p>You might also like to check out the following pages, where we provide all the latest online betting bonus codes and offer details for some of our top-rated sports gambling sites.</p>

          {/* leave the image box */}

          <Title title={'Common Sports Betting Bonuses and Promos'}/>
          <Wideimage src={'/image/'}/>
          <p>You might be wondering, “can I claim an online betting offer?”</p>
          <p>The good news is that you probably can. Every online betting bonus or free bet has terms you need to fulfill, but so long as you’re betting sports for real money, odds are you can find an offer to bolster your bankroll.

</p>
          <p>The type of betting deal you can claim will depend, though, on whether you’re a new customer or an existing customer. Let’s look at the types of online betting promotions sportsbooks offer each one, starting with sign-up bonuses for new customers.

</p>
          <p>Sports betting sites offer various promotions to encourage new customers to register and account with them, make a deposit, and start betting for real money.

</p>

          {/* leave the list */}

          <TextTitle title={'Deposit Bonus'}/>
          <p>The deposit bonus is the most common promotion betting sites offer. You’ll see this offer labeled differently at each site. For example, welcome bonus or sign-up bonus. But they all work the same way.

</p>
          <p>A deposit bonus is an offer in which the betting website matches a percentage of your deposit. For example, a site might offer a 50% match bonus of up to $1,000. This means they’ll give you $0.50 for every $1 you deposit. If you deposit $2,000, they’ll give you $1,000 extra to bet with.

</p>
          <p>The match percentage will vary from sportsbook to sportsbook. Most sports betting sites with bonuses offer 50% or 100% matches, but it’s not common to find higher or lower matches.

</p>
          <p>The maximum bonus will vary too. As you can see by looking at our recommended bonus betting sites, some sites offer a max bonus of $250 while others offer as much as $1,000.

</p>
          <p>It just depends. A good rule of thumb is that the larger the match, the smaller the maximum bonus, and vice versa. What makes for the best sportsbook sign-up bonus is essentially down to you.

</p>
          <p>Most of the top betting sign-up offers are only valid on your first deposit. However, while less common for sportsbook bonuses, some are split up over your first two or three deposits.

</p>

          {/* leave the top tip */}

          <TextTitle title={'Reduced Juice/Enhanced Odds'}/>
          <p>Another promotion sports betting sites offer new customers is reduced juice. “Juice” is another term used for “vigorish” or “vig,” which is the commission that betting apps and online sportsbooks charge on every bet.

</p>
          <p>Take a standard -110 line, in which you wager $110 to win $100. If the betting site offers reduced juice, that line might be -107 or -105 instead.

</p>
          <p>This means you’re saving $3-$5 (in this example) for every bet you make. This can add up to significant savings over the lifetime of your betting account.

</p>
          <p>Enhanced odds is a similar concept, where you basically get better prices on specific wagers or betting markets.</p>
          <p>The sports betting sites that offer reduced juice to new customers will usually give you a choice. You can either take the reduced juice deal, which will apply to all your bets but will make you ineligible for other betting bonuses and promos. Or you can skip the reduced juice and take the sign-up bonus and other deals instead.

</p>
          <p>We can’t tell you which way to go. You’ll have to do some math to figure out which will yield the best return for you. But what we will say is that, if you don’t bet very often, odds are a deposit bonus will put more money in your pocket.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'No Deposit Bonus'}/>
          <p>A slightly less common betting sign-up offer is the no deposit bonus. This is an offer in which an online bookmaker will give you $10-$30, which is good for a couple of free bets.

</p>
          <p>You don’t have to deposit with this betting site bonus, which is where the “no deposit” part comes from. All you have to do is register an account.

</p>

          <Borderedbox> No-deposit offers aren’t nearly as big as the best sign up bonuses for sports betting, and they usually have stricter terms and conditions, at least as far as withdrawing winnings is concerned.</Borderedbox>

          <p>We don’t recommend joining an online sportsbook or bookmaker for a no deposit bonus unless they also allow you to claim their main welcome bonus. You can use the free bet to test their sportsbook and, if you like it, you can then commit with a deposit and claim a betting bonus.

</p>
          <p>Now, what about existing customers? What do the top betting sites for bonuses offer them?</p>
          <p>Well, existing customers actually have a wider variety of promotions to choose from, as well as sport or event-specific promotions to take advantage of.</p>

          {/* leave the list */}

          <TextTitle title={'Reload Bonuses'}/>
          <p>A reload bonus is essentially identical to a deposit bonus. The sports betting app or site is offering to match a percentage of your deposit.</p>
          <p>Reload bonuses are often smaller than welcome bonuses, but the upside of these sportsbook promotions is that you can claim them more often. Some real money gambling sites even offer a bonus on every deposit you make, such as a 25% “lifetime” reload bonus.

</p>
          <p>Here are some details of the reloads available at a few top sports gambling sites with bonuses.

</p>

          {/* leave the table */}

          <TextTitle title={'Free Bets'}/>
          <p>A free bet is a betting site promotion in which if you make a bet and it loses, the sportsbook will refund you the amount you lost. The refund is usually capped at between $25-$50. Or it can be a “token,” where you get to make a real money wager for free. You’ll keep the winnings but not the value of the initial wager.

</p>
          <p>Some sites use free bet bonuses to encourage you to try something in their sportsbook, such as their live sportsbook or mobile betting app.

</p>
          <p>If you’ve already used that feature or section, the promotion won’t be available to you. And if you make a bet and it wins, you won’t be able to claim it again.

</p>
          <p>Otherwise, it’s essentially a risk-free way to add some winnings to your bankroll.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Rebates'}/>
          <p>A rebate is an offer in which sports gambling sites give you back a percentage of your net losses. This betting promotion is most commonly offered to horse bettors, but some sportsbooks offer sitewide rebates, too.

</p>
          <p>Here’s how a betting rebate works.

</p>
          <p>The most common rebate given is 8%. If you wager $500 and lose $300, your net loss is $200, in which case the site will refund you $16.

</p>

          <Borderedbox> Most rebates are paid on a weekly basis based on your losses from Sun-Sat or Mon-Sun.</Borderedbox>

          <TextTitle title={'Refer-a-Friend'}/>
          <p>Many online gambling sites offer a refer-a-friend program. Every program is different, but the gist is that the site will give you a bonus or other incentive for every friend you refer that makes a real money deposit and wager.</p>
          <p>They don’t even have to bet on sports. Most sites also have casino games and/or poker available, and if your friend plays either of those, you’ll still get your bonus.

</p>
          <p>And that wraps it up for the most common betting bonuses and promotions that online sports betting sites offer. But this is far from all the betting site promotions you’ll find online.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Other Promotions and Rewards at Sports Betting Sites'}/>
          <p>Several online betting sites also offer VIP programs or loyalty schemes. These can provide additional rewards based on how much you wager. If you’re a high-stakes bettor or bet very regularly, such rewards can end up being very valuable.

</p>
          <p>These rewards are not necessarily limited to cash. Some betting rewards programs offer various gifts and prizes, or even VIP trips to sports events.

</p>
          <p>Betting promotions for specific events like the start of the NFL season, the Super Bowl, or March Madness are also reasonably common. It’s not unusual for an online bookmaker or sportsbook to increase their standard bonus for a major event or offer specific bonuses for betting on that event.

</p>
          <p>Many betting websites will also run contests based on big sports events. These are typically free to enter for regular customers or anyone who has placed a real money wager on the relevant event.

</p>

          {/* leave the blue list */}

          <p>Generally speaking, the bigger the event the more special offers and deals you’ll find. US betting sites typically go crazy with their Super Bowl promotions, for example, while UK betting sites will offer plenty of deals around the start of the English Premier League season.</p>
          <p>Betting promos based on using a new or upgraded feature are also sometimes available. For example, you might get a free bet for using a new live betting platform. Or a special offer for using the latest version of a mobile betting app.</p>
          <p>You’ll also find betting site bonuses for using a specific deposit method. These are especially common at US online sportsbooks for using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency is arguably the best way to deposit and withdraw funds for real money online gambling in the United States, and most sites actively encourage it.
</p>
          <p>Take a look at the current Bitcoin betting bonuses available at some of our top-rated sportsbooks.

</p>

          {/* leave the table */}
          <p>Most promotions at sports betting sites with bonuses will fall under one of the labels listed in this section. So once you’re familiar with these, you’ll have no problem understanding how all the other betting promos work.

</p>

          <Title title={'How to Claim a Betting Bonus Online'}/>
          <Wideimage src={'/image'}/>
          <p>The process for how to claim a bonus bet or reward varies from one sportsbook to the next, especially for promotions for existing customers.

</p>
          <p>However, claiming a sign-up offer will generally be pretty much the same regardless of the bonus betting site you join.

</p>
          <p>Here are the steps you need to take.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Choose a Betting Site'}/>
          <p>The first thing you need is an account with an online betting site that offers bonuses. If your bankroll can handle it, we recommend you join a minimum of two sportsbooks, and preferably three.

</p>
          <p>You want to have accounts with two or three online bookmakers with bonuses (minimum) because every site will offer action on events and markets that the others don’t.

</p>
          <p>Multiple betting sites also make it easy to compare and take the best odds, which is one of the easiest ways to make/save money when betting sports online.

</p>
          <p>There are many ways to choose which site to bet with. But the easiest way is to simply join one or three of the real money betting sites with bonuses that we recommend.

</p>

          {/* leave the image box */}

          <p>These are the best sports betting bonus sites online today.  Why not piggyback off our effort and save yourself some time, money, and frustration?

</p>
          <p>That’s what we’d do. The choice is yours, though.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Create Your Account'}/>
          <p>The next step is to create an account. Just find and click the “sign up” or “join now” button that most betting sites have placed in easy-to-find locations throughout their site.

</p>
          <p>This will take you to a page where you’ll need to provide some information. Here are the details most sports betting sites with bonuses ask for.

</p>

          {/* leave the list */}

          <p>This is more or less what every online gambling site will ask for. They’re not trying to be nosey. They just want to make sure it’s legal for you to use their site and that you’re not a scammer.

</p>
          <p>Once you finish this part, most sportsbooks will send you a confirmation email. Open this email and click the link inside it to “confirm” your account – another safety and security measure.

</p>
          <p>You now have an account that’s ready to use.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Make a Deposit'}/>
          <p>The next step is to make a deposit, which is an important step if you want to gamble on sports for real money, not to mention claim a betting bonus.

</p>
          <p>This process is pretty much the same at every online betting site with bonuses. The biggest difference between each site is the banking options they accept.

</p>
          <p>Here are the most common banking options they accept.

</p>

          {/* leave the list */}

          <p>Most sportsbooks also accept region or country-specific banking options.

</p>
          <p>You can read our reviews to see if a betting site has the specific banking method you want to use. Or you can create a free account and look for yourself.

</p>

          {/* leave top tip */}

          <TextTitle title={'Choose Your Betting Bonus or Promotion'}/>
          <p>The depositing step is also when you’ll decide which betting promo you want to claim if there are multiple options. You may also have to enter a bonus code or promo code.

</p>
          <p>This part is simple. Just enter the bonus code for the sportsbook promotion you want to claim in the relevant spot. Make sure you do this before you submit your deposit request.

</p>
          <p>And that’s all there is to it. The offer should be available immediately (though that depends on the specific betting offer you claimed).

</p>
          <p>Now, with that primer out of the way, let’s get into the exceptions. Because there are always exceptions.

</p>
          {/* leave the list */}
          <p>Most of the top bonus betting sites will tell you how to claim their offer in their terms and conditions. You don’t want to screw this part up. Otherwise, you risk losing out on a bonus, free bonus bet, or other promotion.

</p>
          <p>It’s one of the many reasons why you need to read every sportsbook’s bonus terms and conditions.

</p>

          <Title title={'Understanding Bonus Terms and Conditions'}/>
          <Wideimage src={'/image'}/>
          <p>Betting promotions are fun and exciting. They can put lots of money in your pocket and help you build your bankroll.</p>
          <p>But there is a serious side too – the terms and conditions.

</p>
          <p>Betting sites have bonus terms in conditions for many reasons, but these two are arguably the most important.

</p>

          <Mainbullet link={''} title={''}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} title={''}/>

          <p>Bonus terms swing the odds in the sportsbooks’ favor. That shouldn’t be a surprise, really. Sportsbooks are in business to make money after all, not to give it away.

</p>
          <p>That doesn’t mean you can’t make money from your bonus bets or rebates, though. But you’ll screw up your chances of making any money if you break the terms for the offer you claimed.

</p>
          <p>This is easy to avoid, though. All you have to do is read and follow the terms for every betting promo you claim. The following are the most common terms to look out for.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Rollover Requirement'}/>
          <p>Also known as a wager or playthrough requirement, this is the most common term or “rule” you’ll have to follow.

</p>
          <p>A rollover requirement is a multiple that is applied to your deposit and/or bonus. The outcome is an amount of money you’ll need to wager before you can withdraw your winnings.

</p>
          <p>For example, say you claim a 100% sportsbook bonus. You deposit $500 and get an extra $500 to bet with. The rollover terms are 10x and apply to both the deposit and bonus.

</p>
          <p>Here’s what the math will look like.

</p>

          <Borderedbox> [deposit + deposit bonus] * [rollover requirement] = amount to wager
</Borderedbox>

          <p>Plug in our example numbers, and you’ll see that we’ll need to wager $10,000 before we can cash out our winnings.</p>
          <p>That’s how rollover requirements work in a nutshell. You’ll want to keep in mind that some rollover requirements apply only to the bonus or deposit, while others apply to both (combined).</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Expiration Date'}/>
          <p>This term tells you how long you have to complete the bonus.

</p>
          <p>Many sportsbook offers have expiration dates that are between 14-30 days, though it varies quite a bit.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Minimum Odds'}/>
          <p>This tells you the minimum odds you need to take while clearing an offer.

</p>
          <p>For example, an offer might say that every bet must be at odds of 2.5:1 or higher. Bets on odds smaller than that won’t count or apply to the rollover.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Minimum/Maximum Bet'}/>
          <p>This term tells you how little and how much you can bet while clearing a sports betting bonus or bonus bet. For example, the minimum bet might be $1, and the maximum bet might be $10.

</p>
          <p>Minimum and maximum bets are less common in the sportsbook than in other areas, such as the casino.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Maximum Win'}/>
          <p>This tells you the maximum amount you can win from a bet.

</p>
          <p>This rule might be specific to the betting promotion, or it might be a rule that applies regardless of whether you’re using a bonus or not.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Maximum Withdrawal Amount'}/>
          <p>This tells you the maximum winnings you can withdraw from a specific bet or offer.

</p>
          <p>And if you withdraw your winnings, oftentimes the sportsbook will void the rest of your bonus/winnings.

</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Refer-a-Friend'}/>
          <p>These terms will tell you how much your friend needs to deposit and rollover before the betting site will give you your bonus. They will also tell you whether you need to rollover your bonus or incentive, and by how much.

</p>
          <p>And that wraps it up for the most common terms and conditions that you’ll need to follow if you claim an online betting promotion.

</p>
          <p>Again, to reiterate how important this is, many betting sites will simply void your bonus and/or winnings if you fail to follow their terms. If you try to cash out too soon, make the wrong bets, or do anything that breaks the terms, you’ll lose out on potentially hundreds or thousands of dollars.

</p>
          <p>This is why we include the major terms and conditions for every major offer we write about in our betting site reviews. We don’t want you to lose out on lots of money on a technicality.

</p>
          <p>And you better believe that sports betting sites will embrace these technicalities if it means not having to send you thousands of dollars in winnings.

</p>
          <p>So, don’t shirk your homework. Read the terms and conditions for every sports betting promotion you claim. Do that and you’ll be that much closer to lining your pocket with hundreds and thousands of dollars in online sports betting bonuses, free bonus bets, rebates, and more.</p>
          <p>Here’s a breakdown of the terms and conditions for some of the best real money online sportsbook bonuses available.</p>

          {/* leave the table */}
          <Title title={'Sports Betting Bonuses FAQ'}/>
          {/* FAQ */}

          <Title title={'Get the Best Online Betting Deals'}/>

          <p>Billions of dollars are wagered on sports every year. A lot of this money comes from offline wagers, which are made at sportsbooks and bookmakers that don’t offer free bets and sign-up bonuses.

</p>
          <p>We think this is a little silly. Why would you spend hundreds or thousands of dollars offline and get only your winnings in return (maybe).

</p>
          <p>That’s why we love betting sports online, especially at the sportsbooks we recommend. Every one of them offers promotions like welcome bonuses, free bets, rebates, and other deals that line your pockets with cash.

</p>
          <p>It’s extra money that you’ll get for betting sports, something you were going to do anyway. So why not collect some bonus cash while you’re at it?

</p>
          <p>It’s easy to do. All you have to do is place your bets online. And for the best betting bonuses and promotions, we recommend you join one of the sites we endorse.</p>
          <p>Here’s a reminder of the top sports betting sites for bonuses and rewards right now.
