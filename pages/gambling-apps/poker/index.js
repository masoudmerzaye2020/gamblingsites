            The evolution of real money poker apps over the past few years has
            given a huge boost to the world’s most popular card game. Modern
            technology means you can easily access online poker tournaments and
            cash games from your mobile device.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the help of our poker experts, we have identified the best
            poker apps you can find on the internet today. Additionally, we have
            put together an informative guide to help you understand how we
            identify the top mobile apps for playing real money poker online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even with the benefit of cutting edge technology, there are some
            mobile poker apps that are clearly better than others. Of course,
            spending hour after hour trying to distinguish the best poker apps
            from the pretenders can eat into valuable playing time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our guide to real money poker apps is the solution to this problem.
            We don’t just pluck our recommendations from thin air. Oh no, that
            simply will not fly. We dissect each and every one of the online
            poker apps we recommend to ensure that they are worthy of both our
            time and yours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following a strict set of guidelines, we first ensure that all apps
            are safe, secure, and above board. That means ensuring these poker
            apps are licensed, legal, and will pay out your winnings without any
            hassle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once an app has passed our strict measures, we rank them against
            criteria that scrutinizes their strengths in key areas. Among the
            things we look for is the quality of poker games, the slickness and
            design of the app, and how well they perform for beginners and
            experts alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that’s not all, of course. There’s so much more that the best
            real money poker apps have to offer. Allow us to explain, in more
            detail.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Ranking Real Money Poker Apps"} />
          <p>
            If choosing a poker app was as easy as customizing your personal
            in-game avatar, things would be much easier, right? It’s not,
            though. There are lots to choose from, and standards vary.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing our poker experts agree on, unanimously, is that using the
            best real money poker apps can make a big difference to your overall
            online poker experience. So, although it’s a challenge to separate
            the best from the rest, it’s definitely important.
          </p>
          <p>
            The poker apps we recommend all share similar key features that set
            them apart from the average. We will cover that a little later.
            First, here a few key areas we look out for when ranking mobile
            poker apps.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Safety and Security"} />
          <p>
            Despite us living in a time of unprecedented technical superiority,
            safety and security are not guaranteed. Thankfully, we know what to
            look for when recommending online poker apps, having spent so much
            time weeding out the bad from the good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you prefer Texas Hold’em or Omaha, or need an iPhone poker
            app or an Android poker app, the thing that matters the most is
            safety. When you’re playing real money poker from a mobile device,
            you need to know that everything is secure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Can you trust the software when downloading it to your device? Are
            your funds safe? Will your sensitive data be protected?
          </p>

          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              Our recommended poker apps have all been vetted to ensure they’re
              100% safe and secure.
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>

          <TextTitle title={"Legality"} />
          <p>
            You might be surprised to learn that there are some really shady
            poker apps accessible today. Many of these are marketed as the best
            around, but they are anything but. In fact, some of them are not
            even legal.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ensure that every real money poker app we recommend to you is
            above board. They are all fully licensed and regulated through a
            reputable gaming authority, and tick the necessary boxes when it
            comes to trustworthiness and reliability.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Deposits and Withdrawals"} />
          <p>
            When we are satisfied that the poker apps we review operate safely
            and above board, we tend to focus on how they deal with deposits and
            withdrawals. This can often give insight into how they operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they provide a healthy number of deposit methods, including
            credit and debit cards, e-wallets, Bitcoin, pay by phone and the
            like, this is a good sign. If the poker apps make life easier with
            fast and prompt withdrawals with minimal to no fees on transactions,
            or withdrawal limits, we tend to give them a good old green tick.
          </p>
          <p>
            These points are all super important, but there’s more to a great
            online poker app than just meeting these requirements. The best apps
            for real money poker are the ones that go above and beyond, as you
            will find out next.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Qualities of the Top Online Poker Apps"} />
          <p>
            There are free poker apps on iOS, Android, or Windows that will
            allow you to play without putting your hand in your pockets. This
            can be a bit of fun, but playing poker for free is not really what
            the game is about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most players want to use poker apps to win real money. And, although
            playing for real money is still at least partly about having fun,
            it’s a more serious business.
          </p>

          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              With real funds on the line, you want to use the very best apps
              available.
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>

          <p>
            You’ll enhance your playing experience when using the top mobile
            poker apps as they really make a difference. But what actually
            matters here?
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s take a look at some of the qualities that the best poker apps
            all have in common.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"High Traffic"} />
          <p>
            Unlike casino games or slots, playing online poker for real money
            relies on having other players available to go up against. After
            all, you cannot simply hit a button and spin wheels or reels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, in order to have a chance of consistently winning, you
            need enough traffic, i.e. players, to get butts on seats. The more
            players on the tables, the more popular the app is. The more popular
            the app is usually a sound indication of its reputation and standing
            in the poker community.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Range of Games"} />
          <p>
            Another simple indicator of top mobile poker apps played is the
            range of games they have in store for players. Now, we get that most
            players tend to stick to a few titles, but others like having
            choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it’s Hold’em, Omaha, Stud, Razz, Five-Card Draw, 2-7 Single
            Draw, or the many variances of each of these titles, the apps that
            tend to rank highly in our recommendations cater to everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than this, you will typically find most leading poker apps have
            multiple options when it comes to variations and stakes. And that is
            never a bad thing.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Promotions and Bonuses"} />
          <p>
            The best real money poker apps come with welcome bonuses that have
            realistic clearing requirements. Additionally, they have promotions
            and bonuses that cater to a wide range of players and experience
            levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            We all like something for free, but the minds behind the best apps
            will target players who have genuine designs on climbing up that
            ladder. Aside from freerolls and free cash, you will find access to
            VIP programs, rakebacks, and tons of other features that can make
            you feel valued.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Slick Software"} />
          <p>
            Without industry-leading software, apps can fall way behind. Like it
            or not, the poker sites that have the slickest, most attractive
            software usually rank high with players.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the general look of tables and games, to playability
            enhancement driven by artificial intelligence, the right software
            goes a long way towards making an app stand out from the crowd.
          </p>
          <p>No one wants to play poker with ugly software, right?</p>

          <TextTitle title={"Guaranteed Tournaments"} />
          <p>
            Guaranteed tournaments, or guaranteed prize pools, are another
            indicator of a poker app that values its players. Many enthusiasts
            flock to these tournaments, for obvious reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            When there’s a guaranteed prize pool available, you can rest assured
            knowing you are playing for a set amount of cash, regardless of the
            player pool. This will not just save you time that you might have
            wasted for minimal return, but will also see more players hitting
            the tables as a result.
          </p>
          <p>More players mean more fun, right?</p>

          <TextTitle title={"No HUDs or Tracking Software"} />
          <p>
            HUD (heads up display) software can go a long way towards putting
            many beginners off when playing real money poker online for the
            first time. This software is usually more beneficial to experienced
            players who hope to gain a technical advantage over you. The worst
            thing is that most new players have no idea how they work.
          </p>
          <p>
            HUDs are poker software that will reveal the stats and tendencies of
            players which can be used by grinders to find easier ways to win.
            This, in addition to other tracking software, can work against you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the best mobile poker apps prohibit the use of such tools
            these days.
          </p>

            bound to have some questions. Here are answers to five of the most
