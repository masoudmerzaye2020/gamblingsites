    <Header>Best Live Casino Apps for 2022</Header>
    <Section>
      <Container>
        <p>If you’ve ever played in a live dealer casino online, you know the experience combines the best of both in-person and online gambling. You can play real money casino games with live dealers from the comfort of home.</p>
        <p>You can take these benefits to another level, though. Not only can you play live casino games anytime you want, but you can also play them anywhere by using the best live dealer casino apps.</p>
        {/* leave the add */}
        <p>Playing online casino games for money is a lot of fun. Sure, you’re not going to win every time you play. But it’s such a great feeling when you do!</p>
        <p>Our recommended live casino apps offer so much more than access to gambling tables from a small screen.</p>
        <p>They’re chosen first and foremost for offering safe and secure real money casino gambling. They offer live casino games from licensed and regulated studios that prioritize the player experience.</p>
        <p>You’ll find that the chips and action buttons are comfortable to use. Off-the-table resources like paytables, player chats, and other info are tucked away behind menu icons to keep the playing area clear.</p>
        <p>Casino apps for playing live dealer games online are part of a more extensive mobile-based service, so our rankings also consider banking, customer service, and the RNG gaming collection.</p>
        <Title Title={'What are Live Dealer Casino Apps?'}/>
        <div>
          <Cornerimage src={'/image/gamblingapps/Live-Dealer-Casino-Apps.png'}/>
          <p>Live casino game apps offer mobile-friendly access to the live casino where actual dealers run the tables. You play these live games for money against the house.</p>
          <p>The live casino action is just as you’d find in a land-based casino. If you want to join a live dealer blackjack table, then you might need to wait for one of the seven seats to become available.</p>
          <p>Once you’re in the game, it’s a matter of playing your hand just as you would in person, waiting your turn to act, unless you’re in the first position.</p>
          <p>There are a few twists along the way, though, for your convenience. For example, if you’re waiting for a blackjack seat to open, you can put your name on a waiting list.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, depending on the live casino mobile app you use, you might have the option to “bet behind” another player.</p>
        </div>
        <TextTitle title={'Mobile Apps for Live Casinos Come in Three Formats'}/>
        <p>Here are your options.</p>
        <div className='blue'>
          <Mainbullet link={''} title={'iOS'} desc={'– with an app in the app store (depending on your location)'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} title={'Android'} desc={'– with a download from the Google Play store (very limited)'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} title={'Mobile browser'} desc={'– accessing the full casino site as a mobile browser app (most common)'}/>

        </div>
        <p>Even with a downloadable live casino app for Android or iPhone available, you don’t have to take that route.</p>
        <p>You can still access any of the legit mobile apps for live casinos through your smartphone or tablet browser with no download required. This is typically the best option.</p>
        <TextTitle title={'Getting Started with Live Casino Apps for Real Money'}/>
        <p>Before we get into the fun stuff – the tables and a few non-table live games you can pull up on your mobile device, let’s touch on getting the ball rolling with accessing mobile live casino apps online.</p>
        <p>The first thing you’ll need to know is that live casino apps are the same as live casinos in that they’re part of a more extensive operation. Live casinos are hosted within online casinos or full-service online gambling sites.</p>
        <p>So, if you’re a registered player of a casino site with live dealer games, then your login will work on that casino’s live dealer mobile app.</p>
        <p>If you don’t have a login, you can sign up for a new account on your computer or your mobile device.</p>
        <p>Either way, you’ll need to deposit some cash if you want to play the live casino games for money. This can also be done from your mobile device.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Features at the Top Live Casino Apps Online'}/>
        <p>When you use real money gambling apps with live casino games on your smartphone or tablet, you’ll have as many or even more controls and visual options compared to those on desktops and laptops.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the highlights of the best live gambling apps.</p>

        <p>When was the last time you were able to turn the music or sound down when you played at the casino in person?</p>

        <Title title={'Top Providers of Mobile Live Casino Games'}/>
        <p>Online slot players quickly learn the names behind their favorite machines.</p>

        <p>Ask a slot enthusiast to pick a Betsoft, Rival, or RealTime Gaming slot out of a lineup and odds are they could do it, no sweat.</p>
        <p>The same goes for live dealer casinos. Some studios stand out above the rest for their unique games, generous table limits, and friendly dealers. Live casino enthusiasts can pick their games out of a lineup, no problem.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Each of these live dealer casino game apps is slightly different, depending on the host gambling site and location. They feature various table limits, languages, and table combinations.</p>
        <p>The one thing they all have in common, though? Every single one of these online gambling apps with live dealer casino games offers high-quality, exciting real money casino action with real people on real equipment.</p>

        <Title title={'Real Money Blackjack on Live Casino Apps'}/>
        <p>You won’t find a legitimate live casino app without at least one blackjack table. It’s one of the most popular casino games played on mobile devices.</p>
        <p>Blackjack is easily customized with side bets, common draw options, and other minor changes that make a significant difference.</p>
        <p>These are the best live casino blackjack games.</p>

        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} title={'Best for US players:'} desc={' Seven-Seat Blackjack'}/>

        </div>

        <TextTitle title={'Seven-Seat Blackjack'}/>
        <p>Casinos with live dealer apps featuring Fresh Deck Studios’ Seven-Seat Blackjack offers a few advantages.</p>

        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''}  desc={'Open to US players'}/>

        </div>

        <p>Fresh Deck Studios is an aggregator of live casino games, specifically for US-facing casinos and casino apps. It prioritizes mobile play, so it’s also one of the better US live dealer casino apps.</p>
        <p>While the table is limited to seven seats, the bet behind feature lets everyone participate. Just keep in mind that you can’t make any decisions when you’re not in the virtual chair.</p>

        <Squareimage src={'/image/gamblingapps/Mobile-Seven-Seat-Blackjack-Fresh-Deck-Studios.png'} desc={'Seven-Seat Blackjack from Fresh Deck Studios'}/>

        <TextTitle title={'Six Deck Blackjack'}/>
        <p>Like the Fresh Deck game, Six Deck Blackjack has limited seats but a bet behind option.</p>
        <p>The simple, no side bets, blackjack game is in real money live casino apps using Pragmatic Play tables.</p>
        <p>This game is an excellent choice for mobile users because it’s the fastest-playing table. Players don’t have to wait for each other to act with auto stand and deal now functions.</p>

        <Squareimage src={'/image/gamblingapps/01_600x350_pragmatic-blackjack.png'}/>

        <TextTitle title={'Perfect Blackjack'}/>
        <p>Perfect Blackjack isn’t for everyone, but if a live autoplay game sounds like fun, then you’ll like this game from Net Entertainment.</p>
        <p>On NetEnt live casino sites, Perfect Blackjack has a low 0.5% house edge, and a table limit starting at just 3.00. It’s a community table so you can play up to three hands at a time, preselecting auto splits and double downs.</p>
        <p>From there, though, the dealer takes over and plays the hand with optimal strategy.</p>

        <Squareimage src={'/image/gamblingapps/01_600x350_perfect-blackjack-netent.png'}/>

        <TextTitle title={'Other Blackjack Games at Online Live Dealer Apps'}/>

        {/* leave the table */}

        <Title title={'Mobile Live Roulette on Casino Gambling Apps'}/>

        <p>Roulette is a little trickier to set up on live dealer online casino apps. But once you get your bets in place, you can let them ride.</p>
        <p>You’ll find that the best live casino apps provide multiple camera angles for their roulette tables, so users can switch views, zooming in on the wheel, betting table, or racetrack. </p>
        <p>These are the most entertaining roulette games on real money live casino mobile apps.</p>

        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''}  desc={'European Roulette by Visionary iGaming'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''}  desc={'French Roulette Gold by Evolution Gaming'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''}  desc={'Auto Roulette Studio by NetEnt'}/>
        </div>

        <TextTitle title={'European Roulette – Best for Americans'}/>
        <p>Visionary iGaming is one of the top live casino providers for US casinos, and its European Roulette table is ideal for mobile app access.</p>
        <p>European Roulette is a variation that uses a single zero wheel. The way this game is presented makes the difference on mobile.</p>
        <p>ViG produces the game with multiple camera angles and a picture-in-picture view, so you get a close-up of the wheel in motion.</p>

        <Squareimage src={'/image/gamblingapps/01_600x350_European-Roulette-from-ViG.png'} desc={'European Roulette from ViG.'}/>


        <TextTitle title={'French Roulette Gold – Elegant Simplicity'}/>
        <p>Evolution Gaming has a long list of mobile roulette tables, but French Roulette Gold is the right choice for players accessing them from live casino apps.</p>
        <p>It’s a simple and elegantly presented game with the La Partage rule.</p>

        <Squareimage src={'/image/gamblingapps/01_600x350_Evolution-Gamings-French-Roulette-Gold.png'} desc={'Evolution Gaming’s French Roulette Gold.'}/>

        <TextTitle title={'Auto Roulette Studio – For Mobile Table-hopping'}/>
        <p>NetEnt has set aside an entire section of its studio-based casino for roulette. Players can use the NetEnt live casino app to visit one of the roulette tables (rapid, classic, or VIP).</p>
        <p>From there, though, there’s no need to return to the virtual lobby. Instead, the entire studio is open for players to wander around and try out different roulette experiences.</p>

        <Squareimage src={'/image/gamblingapps/01_600x350_Auto-Roulette-from-NetEnt.png'} desc={'Auto Roulette from NetEnt.'}/>

        <Title title={'More Casino Games on Live Dealer Apps'}/>
        <div>
          <Cornerimage src={'/image/gamblingapps/Live-Dealer-Baccarat-poker.png'}/>
          <p>Baccarat and poker also pop up on some of the more prominent apps with live dealer casino games.</p>
          <p>Live dealer baccarat typically sticks to commission or no commission with the occasional dragon bet on the side. But there’s not much distinguishing one table from another.</p>
          <p>There are several live casino poker games too, though these aren’t as common – their availability depends on the online live dealer casino app you download.</p>
          <p>Because there’s not much deviation in table variations going from one mobile casino to another, we wanted to highlight a few of the unique app-based live dealer games you can play.</p>
        </div>

        <TextTitle title={'Live Roulette with a Progressive Jackpot'}/>

        <p>Just the brief description might have you a bit confused. After all, how many times do you come across a roulette table with a jackpot? Blackjack? Yes. Poker? Yes. But roulette?</p>
        <p>Well, Playtech found a way to crank up the volume on its live roulette by giving it the Age of the Gods treatment in Live Age of the Gods Bonus Roulette.</p>
        <p>Age of the Gods (AOTG) is one of Playtech’s premier progressive jackpot slots network. But Live Age of the Gods Bonus Roulette merges the randomly triggered jackpot game with a unique roulette table.</p>
        <p>Not only is it possible to get an invitation to play for one of four progressive jackpots, including a grand prize starting at 100,000.00, but there’s another bonus element in play.</p>
        <p>Instead of a double-zero spot, there’s a bonus wedge prediction. When it lands, anyone in the running gets three free spins on a three-reel slot game with prizes up to X300.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'Meet Uncle Pennybags'}/>
        <p>Evolution Gaming’s MONOPOLY Live combines a live dealer wheel-based game with an RNG bonus game hosted by none other than Mr. MONOPOLY.</p>
        <p>It’s an award-winning betting opportunity that plays like Dream Catcher, where you make simple predictions on wheel spins.</p>
        <p>But in this version, some bonus wedges are added. If you bet them and win, you’ll take an unusual 3D trip around the game board, collecting cash and multipliers.</p>
        <p>Besides MONOPOLY Live and Dream Catcher, Evolution Gaming also has a Crazy Time wheel game in its mobile app.</p>

        <TextTitle title={'A Baccarat Table with Many Side Bets'}/>
        <p>Knockout Baccarat is available on real money baccarat apps with live dealer games from Ezugi. It’s one of the most unusual tables, not because of the gameplay but the side bets.</p>
        <p>Most baccarat tables stick to the basics, but this one lets you predict totals.</p>
        <div>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Total of 1, 2, 3, or 4 = 7:1'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Total of 5 or 6 = 3:1'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Total of 7 = 4:1'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Total of 8 = 3:1'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Total of 9 = 2:1'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Player natural win = 4:1'}/>
          <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Banker natural win = 4:1'}/>
        </div>

        <p>You can keep it simple with Player, Banker, or Ties, or go crazy with lots of side bet action.</p>
        <p>Here are some other games you can play at most live dealer casino sites.</p>

        <Title title={'Pros and Cons of Mobile Live Casinos'}/>
