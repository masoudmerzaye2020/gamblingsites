          <p>
            There’s little doubt that BetUS Casino is the best blackjack app for
            money on Android devices. It’s also a great option on iOS. You can
            enjoy over 20 different variants of the game, as well as tables with
            live dealers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike most of the mobile blackjack casinos on the web, BetUS also
            offers plenty of bonuses and promotions for the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the regular bonuses and promotions can be used on blackjack
            tables, although the conditions are far from perfect. There are also
            exclusive promos for playing blackjack.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, BetUS offers some of the fastest payments among
            legit blackjack apps. If you request a payout with Bitcoin or
            another crypto, your money will often reach you on the same day.

            We have a team of experts who test the different online gambling
            apps that offer blackjack. Before they even hit the mobile blackjack
            tables, they first assess some important general criteria. This
            includes safety and security, payout speeds, support, and user
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we know that that a mobile casino can be trusted and meets some
            basic standards, it’s eligible to be considered a top online
            blackjack app. We then rank all the eligible apps based on the
            following factors.
          </p>

              desc={

            <Mainbullet
              link={""}
              title={"Bonuses and Promotions"}
              desc={
                " – Many mobile casinos don’t have any blackjack bonuses. That can affect your chances to win real money on a blackjack app. The good news is that some of the safest mobile gambling sites we recommend are among the exceptions."
              }
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            That last point needs additional clarification. Even some of our
            highly recommended blackjack apps online aren’t great when it comes
            to blackjack bonuses. Blackjack is often excluded completely from
            bonuses, or only contributes a small percentage towards wagering
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for this is that the house edge in blackjack is very low
            compared to most casino games, especially if you use an optimal
            strategy. If apps let you play blackjack for real money and benefit
            from their best bonuses, they are likely to get crushed.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, some top blackjack apps do have offers that add extra
            value. Let’s take a look at them.
          </p>

          {/* table llklklkj */}
          <p>
            The reality is that blackjack is not the greatest casino game for
            bonuses. The excellent house edge makes up for that, though, and
            some of the best online blackjack apps do provide at least some
            suitable promos.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have never played real money blackjack games on a mobile
            device, you might be a little apprehensive. Don’t be! It’s a great
            experience and easy to get started. To begin with, you just need to
            download the app or go to the casino’s mobile responsive page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then you should pick the table that suits you best and start
            playing. Whether you’re using Android blackjack apps or iOS mobile
            casinos, the experience is basically the same.
          </p>

          <p>
            The rules revolve around the familiar formula, so you’re dealt two
            cards and can hit/stand/double/split, depending on the variant
            you’re playing. Here are some of the variants commonly offered by
            trusted blackjack gambling apps.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Popular Blackjack Variants"} />
          <p>
            The leading blackjack apps with real money have at least five or six
            variants of the game, as well as live dealer tables. Here’s what you
            need to know about the most common ones.
          </p>

            These variants are available on most of the real money blackjack
            apps featured on this page. If you want more information about them,
            and the rules that change between the different versions of
            blackjack, please visit the following page.

            If you are a fan of land-based casinos, you’ll be pleased to know
            that there are mobile blackjack games with live dealers. These
            almost make you feel like you’re playing in a real casino when
            you’re on your phone or tablet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of our recommended real money apps for blackjack offer this
            option, and the technology is surprisingly simple. The casino
            basically delivers a high-quality live stream from a studio or a
            brick-and-mortar casino.
          </p>
          <p>
            You get the best of both worlds because there’s a real croupier that
            deals the hands combined with a simple user interface and a fast
            pace.

          <p>
            The top apps to play blackjack for cash usually have several live
            tables with different variants and limits. The only downside here is
            that live games usually require a faster connection and there’s
            higher data usage. If you can live with that, it’s an awesome
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s the best blackjack app for live dealer games that works on
            iOS, Android, and other mainstream mobile devices.

            If you don’t feel comfortable using a real money blackjack app,
            there are plenty of apps that don’t require you to spend anything.
            You can use them to have fun and enjoy the game, or even test
            different strategies and prepare for when you are ready to try
            mobile blackjack for money.
          </p>
          <p>There are a couple of options here, so let’s explore them.</p>

          <TextTitle title={"Free Blackjack Apps that Pay Real Money"} />
          <p>
            Most real money blackjack apps have free versions of their games,
            and you only need to open a new account to give them a try.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are free download blackjack apps, and some are even accessible
            from the browser of your mobile device. These are great because you
            can always switch and play real money blackjack on Android or iOS
            without much of a hassle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some real gambling blackjack apps also offer no deposit bonuses
            every now and then. If you are lucky, you can win real cash without
            ever risking your own money.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s also another option if you’re not really concerned about
            trying to win money.
          </p>

            All of the options above are solid and available on iPhone, iPad,
            and Android. You’ll find them in the app stores. The problem with
            social casino apps is that you can’t win money playing the game.
            Even those that have in-app purchases don’t pay out real money.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why we recommend using a real cash blackjack app, even if you
            just want to play for free. All the real money gambling apps on this
            page give you that option. You can also find more of our recommended
            casino apps on the following page.
