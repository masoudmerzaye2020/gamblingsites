                <Title title={'Real Money vs Play Money vs The Kitchen Table'}/>
                <p>You’re probably wondering why we’re so adamant about titling our sections “Real money Online Poker” and not just “online poker”. The reason is that playing for real money online is SIGNIFICANTLY different than playing for play money online or playing for fun at home with your family. You can tell it’s significantly different because we capitalized the entire word.</p>
                <p>We want to walk you through some of the big differences between playing online for play money and playing online for real money.</p>
                <TextTitle title={'Play Money'}/> 
                <p>Play money goes by a lot of different terms…play money, practice chips, free play…Regardless of what you call it, play money refers to the chips you get to play with online that are not real money. They are chips that you can use to play in games against other people with play money. If you win millions in play money chips, you can cash them in for $0. They are worth no monetary value.</p>
                <p>On the flip side, if you lose all of your play money chips, you can click a button and just get more. There are multiple reasons that sites allow you to play with play money. They are not making any money off of the play money chips as they are free to anyone that creates an account and can be reloaded for free as well.</p>
                <p>The reasons that sites give you play money chips:</p>
                <p>They want you to learn their software and get used to how it feels to play on the site. The play money software is the exact same as the real money, just not for real money. You can start to get comfortable with the controls, how to raise, how the cards look etc. Personally, we always recommend trying out play money for at least a few minutes before playing for real money to make sure you are comfortable with everything. This prevents costly mistakes with real money.

</p>
                <p>There’s a reason that companies give free samples of their product. They want you to get the feeling of what it’s like and hopefully purchase the real thing. This is the same concept. Sites want you to remember how much fun poker is and understand how easy it is to get playing online. Once you get the itch, it’s going to be a quick switch over to real money.

</p>
                <p>Strategically speaking, play money and real money are going to be WAY different. While some of these differences might be obvious to some, most people are initially oblivious to them until they are clearly pointed out. Ignoring these differences can cost you serious money and make for an awful time when you make the switch from play money to real money online.</p>
                <p>We’re going to cover these important strategic differences in our Real Money section below.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Real Money'}/> 
                <p>Playing poker for real money instead of just play chips makes the entire experience much more exciting and potentially a lot more lucrative for you if you’re good enough. Poker is a game of skill and can be beaten long term. Yes, you may lose in the short run, but the better players are going to always prevail in the long run and come out on top.</p>
                <p>Let’s talk about some of the strategic differences we alluded to above in the play money section. There’s a popular TV show in the United States called Shark Tank. The show features four insanely successful and rich entrepreneurs that hear business idea pitches from new entrepreneurs looking to secure funding for their project. The four “sharks” decide if they like the ideas and then have the option of investing their own money into the company for a portion of ownership or royalties.</p>
                <p>Mark Cuban, one of the most successful businessmen on the planet is one of the sharks. His famous question he always asks is how much each of the entrepreneurs has invested of their own money in their project. If they say none, he immediately is out as he feels like the person can’t care that much if they don’t have a financial stake in the situation.</p>
                <p>The same is true for play money vs. real money. How seriously do you think people are taking the game when they are playing for play money? The answer is not seriously at all. People will go all-in at crazy times and never fold because it’s just play money. They have nothing to lose, and they play that way. This is all well and good because they are having fun, but it is not a good representation of what things are like when you are playing for real money.

</p>
                <p>If we make a big bet as a bluff and it costs our opponent $0 to call and see what we have, how often are they going to fold? The answer is probably never. If we make the same big bet as a bluff, but it costs our opponent $200 in real cash to call and see what we have, they may be much less likely to call for the heck of it.</p>
                <p>The point here is that what works at the play money tables is probably not going to work at the real money tables. Some people say they plan to use play money to practice before moving to real money and that is just a bad idea. Frankly, you’re much better off starting with real money and playing for super low stakes so there is at least something on the line and you’ll be a bit closer to how things will be at the higher stakes.</p>
                <p>Strategically speaking, people are generally going to be tighter and play “more correctly” when real money is on the line. In tournaments, they will be much more reactive to the changing stages of the tournament, specifically the bubble. The bigger the monetary difference is between cashing and not cashing, the more people are going to react.</p>
                <p>In a play money tournament, that difference is $0, so people aren’t going to care at all whether they cash or not. In a super low stakes tournament, that might be a few dollars which will result in some, but not a huge effect on players. As you move up in the real money stakes, that difference will increase and so will the amount that people react.</p>
                <p>The takeaway here is that people are going to play differently than they do in play money. Trying to practice and hone your skills in play money for a switch to real money is like trying to learn baseball by practicing softball. It’s similar, but the nuances are going to bite you in the butt when you make the switch.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'The Benefits of Real Money over Play Money'}/> 
                <p>When we’re talking about real money here, we don’t mean the highest stakes they have. We don’t even mean the most popular stakes. Most of this becomes true the second any money is put on the line. Don’t ever feel like you have to play higher stakes than you are comfortable with. Just remember that the game will change as you move up.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Ability to Practice Strategy Effectively'}/> 
                <p>As we’ve already beat like a dead horse, the play money tables are a terrible place for you to practice any sort of strategy you ever plan to use for real money. The only way to truly see what is going to work and what will not is to employ those tactics for real money. In a game where pressure from the fear of losing money is the driving force, it only works when that fear actually exists.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Ability to Make Money'}/> 
                <p>It’s pretty clear that you can’t make any money using play money. While you also can’t lose any money, poker is a skill game that can be bested by the best in the game. Most players’ ultimate goal in poker is to get better and be able to start making some extra money or possibly take things a step further and play for a living. Obviously, you are going to need to be playing for real money if you want to make that happen. Last we checked, play money chips don’t pay bills.

</p>

                <Title title={'Online Poker vs Live Poker – What You Need to Know'}/>
                <p>The above section is great for people that are already playing online making the switch from play money to real money. However, what about some of you that are making the switch from playing at home games or in brick and mortar casinos to the online realm? Don’t worry, we’re here for you and have a lot of good information that you need to know.

</p>
                <p>There are significant differences when it comes to playing online poker. You may think that it’s the same game (and it technically is), but there are several nuances about the game that are different and need to be accounted for by you.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Quality vs Quantity'}/> 
                <p>Online poker players are notorious for playing multiple games at once. In fact, most successful players will opt to play more games at lower stakes to generate a higher profit. For example, let’s say that a player can beat $1/$2 NLH for $20 an hour when they play that game. That’s 10 times the big blind they win on average per hour. Let’s also say that if that player drops down in stakes and plays $0.50/$1, they can beat the game for 12 times the big blind, or $12 an hour.</p>
                <p>Many online players will opt to play 2 or more tables of $0.50/$1 where things are “easier” than the $1/$2 game. If they play the 2 lower staked games, they will make $24 an hour as opposed to $20 an hour. You may ask why they just don’t play two games of $1/$2. The reason is that the games will be easier at the lower stakes, so they are able to focus less and play more games. If they are capable of doing so at the higher levels, they will.</p>
                <p>What does this mean for you? This means that you’re going to have better players playing at lower stakes online sometimes. A $1/$2 game online can sometimes be tougher than a $1/$2 game in the casino or poker room. We say “sometimes” because this is always dependent on so many other factors.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Bigger Prize Pools'}/> 
                <p>One of the best things about playing online poker versus brick and mortar is that the prize pools in tournaments are typically much higher for much smaller buy-ins. For example, you might play in a live tournament at your local brick and mortar poker room for $200 where first place is $10,000. Online, there are tournaments for $1 that have a prize pool greater than $10,000 (sometimes by a lot).</p>
                <p>Because of the technology of the internet, more people are able to play because the tournament is opened up to all corners of the globe and people don’t have to leave their homes or offices to get in on the action. In fact, some sites allow people to play in tournaments directly from their mobile phones. This results in more players in the tournaments and bigger prize pools which mean more money that you can win.</p>
                <p></p>

                <TextTitle title={'Lower Stakes Available'}/> 
                <p>Unless you live in the middle of nowhere or a super small town with a poker room, the lowest stakes you’re probably going to see in a brick and mortar casino or poker room is $1/$2 for most games. The usual buy-in for this game is $200-$300. This is sometimes A LOT higher than most new players would like to be playing for. Poker lessons can cost you stacks sometimes, and it can get too expensive to learn if every mistake and learning lesson costs you $200-$300 a pop.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Raise Sizes'}/> 
                <p>This is a small nuance but one that usually shocks anyone going from live poker to online poker. If you pay in a $1/$2 No Limit Hold Em game in your local casino, the standard raises pre-flop are usually all over the place. When we play, we see the standard raise being somewhere around 5x-7x the big blind at these games. People are opening the pot for $10-$14 and sometimes higher depending on the game.</p>
                <p>Online, this is way different. The standard opening raise is 2.5x-3x the big blind. Players are raising to $5-$6 pre-flop. The reason for this is that the players in the live setting are usually looser and want to play more hands (probably due to the fact they are only playing one table). Online, the smaller raise garners the same, if not more, respect than it would live.</p>
                <p>Let us say this a different way to make sure it’s clear. If you raise to $6 pre-flop in a live casino or poker room, you are going to get seven or eight people calling you pre-flop. This is not ideal. If you raise to $6 pre-flop online, you will get only a few callers which is much more ideal. For this reason, pots in live games will be much larger and more inflated than pots at the same stakes online.

</p>
                <p>This isn’t really a positive or a negative; it’s just something you need to be aware of and adjust for.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'More Game Variations'}/> 
                <p>The chances are that if you walk into your local card room right now, they are spreading no limit hold em predominantly and maybe some pot limit Omaha and maybe some limit hold em. If you’re a player that likes to play some of the other poker variations like razz or stud, for example, you’re out of luck.</p>
                <p>Online, though, they usually spread every game type you can think of. Now, the games might not be running all the time depending on how big the site is, but they at least have tables set up and ready to go for every variation. Usually, if a game is not running and you sit down, one will start up as more players see that someone is interested in playing a mixed game.</p>

                <Title title={'Online Real Money Poker Game Options'}/>
                <p>Online poker offers the same options that you’re used to in your home casino or poker room, but with some added benefits. They also do have a few additional options that most brick and mortar casinos and poker rooms will not have or will only have a limited number of. We’re going to walk you through the different game options available and discuss some of the added benefits available thanks to the technologies of the internet.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Tournaments'}/> 
                <p>Online poker rooms offer a lot of real money tournament options. A poker tournament is a style of poker where participants pay a fixed entry fee and receive a certain amount of tournament chips. Players then play until one player has all of the chips. Players are not allowed to “cash out” and must complete the tournament. Usually, the top 10-15% of the field is paid money with those towards the top getting paid progressively more.</p>
                <p>Tournaments online differ from those live in a few ways. First, the buy-ins are typically going to be smaller (at least in relation to your major $10k+ events). A major main event online might be a $200 or $1k buy-in event, while live your main events are much more expensive. Now, you may be thinking this stinks in terms of the prize pool, but you would be wrong. Because online tournaments allow players from all over the world to play with much more convenience, the player pools get much larger which mean the prize pool does as well.</p>
                <p>There are weekly tournaments for $200 where you can win several hundred thousand dollars for first place. There are even some tournaments for $1 where you can win five or six figures for first! Yes, this means that you’re going to have to wade through a lot more people as the field size will be larger. But it also means that your risk vs. potential reward is going to be vastly different. You’ll have a much higher potential for reward for a much smaller risk.</p>
                <p>Online poker also offers a lot of real money tournament options that are not available live. The reason these are not available live is that some of these tournament styles are logistically much more difficult to run in a brick and mortar setting. Online, though, everything is handled electronically, and the right computer systems can do anything.</p>
                <p>Also, brick and mortar casinos only have a limited amount of space and tables to run tournaments. This means they’re going to pick the most popular tournament styles that draw in the most people. This will usually be a standard buy-in cash tournament where the winners are paid cash. This would be the type of poker tournament that you are probably most used to.

</p>
                <p>Here are some of the different special variation tournaments that you will probably find online. We’ve attached a very brief description of each to give you an idea of how each of them works. These are incomplete descriptions, and we recommend researching these further if you’re interested in playing one of these formats.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Satellite Tournaments'}/> 
                <p>A satellite tournament is a smaller buy-in tournament that wins you entry into a larger buy-in tournament or event. For example, if you want to play in a $100 tournament but don’t want to spend that kind of money, you can play in a satellite tournament. An example of a satellite tournament would be 10 people playing a tournament for $10 (total prize pool is $100), and the winner of that 10 person tournament gets entry into the $100 tournament.</p>
                <p>Satellites are a way for you to win your entry into bigger events for a smaller amount of money. Brick and mortar casinos will sometimes run satellites, but they will usually only be to their events on their property. Online, though, you have the ability to play satellites to their events as well as live events all over the world.

</p>
                <p>For example, interested in playing in the $10k buy-in WSOP Main Event but don’t have the cash and don’t live in Vegas where the satellites are being run?  A lot of online sites will run satellites to this tournament that you can play from your own home. If you win a seat into the big game, it usually comes with travel money and accommodations. Satellites, as we stated, are a great way to get into the big action and “take your shot” without breaking the bank.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Bounty Tournaments'}/> 
                <p>A bounty tournament is one where not only do you get paid for finishing in the top 10-15%, but you also earn money every time that you knock out a player. Usually, a larger portion of your buy-in will go towards the prize pool, and a smaller portion will go towards your bounty.

</p>
                <p>For example, if the tournament is a $20 buy-in with $5 bounties, $15 of that will go towards the normal prize pool, and then $5 will be set aside for whoever knocks you out. You can end up not making the money in a bounty tournament but still making money!

</p>

                <TextTitle title={'All In or Fold Tournaments'}/> 
                <p>These tournaments are still somewhat rare online but are much more often run there than they ever are in a brick and mortar setting. In this format, you have two options before the flop. You can fold your hand, or you can go all in. This is an extremely fun format but as you can imagine, is a logistical nightmare to run in the brick and mortar setting.</p>
                <p>It requires dealers to count chip stacks every single hand and can take way longer than people like. Online, though, everything is done automatically so this style is able to run as quickly as a traditional tournament but still with the rush of the all in or fold format.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Rebuy Tournaments'}/> 
                <p>These tournaments are actually becoming rarer live as they are being replaced by the next format we will mention below, reentry tournaments. A rebuy tournament is one where you can purchase more chips when you are out of chips or below a certain threshold. The difference between this and a reentry tournament is that you stay in the exact same seat and are not treated as a brand new player. A lot of times rebuy tournaments play a lot crazier during the rebuy period that a normal tournament or even a re-entry tournament during the reentry period.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Re-entry Tournaments'}/> 
                <p>As we mentioned above, these are the tournament styles that are replacing rebuy tournaments in the brick and mortar setting. A re-entry tournament is similar to a rebuy tournament except you can ONLY re-enter when you have zero chips. When you choose to re-enter, you are treated like a brand new player and given a brand new seat and a brand new stack of chips. While online poker sites opt for the rebuy structure over the re-entry structure more, this format is still used a lot online.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Sit and Gos'}/> 
                <p>A sit and go is a tournament with a fixed number of players that does not have an official start time. The tournament starts as soon as enough players are registered for the event. For example, if there is a single table sit and go with nine seats available, the tournament will start as soon as nine people are registered. These are great if you want to play a tournament but don’t want to wait for a scheduled event to start.</p>
                <p>These are also great because you know how many people will be in the event and can better gauge how long the tournament will run. For example, a $10 regular (freezeout) tournament that is scheduled for 1 pm, may get 10 players or it may get 1000 players. Because of this, you won’t know roughly how long the tournament might run until registration is closed and things have started. A nine-person sit and go will ONLY ever have nine players. It will NEVER have any more or any less than that.

</p>
                <p>Yes, these are occasionally run in brick and mortar settings but very rarely and with limited options. You will never find yourself a $5 sit and go in a poker room or casino. Online, though, you will have sit and gos of all levels and all game types. Most sites have sit and gos starting as low as $0.10.</p>

                <TextTitle title={'Step Tournaments'}/> 
                <p>A step tournament is a group of sit and gos that culminate in a grand prize at the top that is usually an entry into a major event. In effect, they’re a form of satellite tournament that is run as a series of sit and gos. Let’s say that you want to win a $12k package to go play in the WSOP Main Event. The package includes your $10k buy-in and $2k for travel and expenses. You could play in a 10 person $1200 sit and go where the winner gets the package. However, $1200 may be a bit more than you were looking to shell out for this shot.</p>
                <p>This is where step tournaments come into play. Each step will be a slightly higher buy-in where the winners will win tickets to play in the next step up, tickets to try the same step again, tickets to a lower step or nada. The idea is to work your way up the steps until you get to the top step and ultimately win that tournament. Let’s look at a quick example of how the steps might be laid out for the above satellite to win the $12k WSOP Main Event package.
