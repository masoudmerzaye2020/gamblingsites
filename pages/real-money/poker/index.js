          <p>
            You’re probably wondering why we’re so adamant about titling our
            sections “Real money Online Poker” and not just “online poker”. The
            reason is that playing for real money online is SIGNIFICANTLY
            different than playing for play money online or playing for fun at
            home with your family. You can tell it’s significantly different
            because we capitalized the entire word.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to walk you through some of the big differences between
            playing online for play money and playing online for real money.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Play Money"} />
          <p>
            Play money goes by a lot of different terms…play money, practice
            chips, free play…Regardless of what you call it, play money refers
            to the chips you get to play with online that are not real money.
            They are chips that you can use to play in games against other
            people with play money. If you win millions in play money chips, you
            can cash them in for $0. They are worth no monetary value.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the flip side, if you lose all of your play money chips, you can
            click a button and just get more. There are multiple reasons that
            sites allow you to play with play money. They are not making any
            money off of the play money chips as they are free to anyone that
            creates an account and can be reloaded for free as well.
          </p>
          <p>The reasons that sites give you play money chips:</p>
          <p>
            They want you to learn their software and get used to how it feels
            to play on the site. The play money software is the exact same as
            the real money, just not for real money. You can start to get
            comfortable with the controls, how to raise, how the cards look etc.
            Personally, we always recommend trying out play money for at least a
            few minutes before playing for real money to make sure you are
            comfortable with everything. This prevents costly mistakes with real
            money.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s a reason that companies give free samples of their product.
            They want you to get the feeling of what it’s like and hopefully
            purchase the real thing. This is the same concept. Sites want you to
            remember how much fun poker is and understand how easy it is to get
            playing online. Once you get the itch, it’s going to be a quick
            switch over to real money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strategically speaking, play money and real money are going to be
            WAY different. While some of these differences might be obvious to
            some, most people are initially oblivious to them until they are
            clearly pointed out. Ignoring these differences can cost you serious
            money and make for an awful time when you make the switch from play
            money to real money online.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re going to cover these important strategic differences in our
            Real Money section below.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Real Money"} />
          <p>
            Playing poker for real money instead of just play chips makes the
            entire experience much more exciting and potentially a lot more
            lucrative for you if you’re good enough. Poker is a game of skill
            and can be beaten long term. Yes, you may lose in the short run, but
            the better players are going to always prevail in the long run and
            come out on top.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s talk about some of the strategic differences we alluded to
            above in the play money section. There’s a popular TV show in the
            United States called Shark Tank. The show features four insanely
            successful and rich entrepreneurs that hear business idea pitches
            from new entrepreneurs looking to secure funding for their project.
            The four “sharks” decide if they like the ideas and then have the
            option of investing their own money into the company for a portion
            of ownership or royalties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mark Cuban, one of the most successful businessmen on the planet is
            one of the sharks. His famous question he always asks is how much
            each of the entrepreneurs has invested of their own money in their
            project. If they say none, he immediately is out as he feels like
            the person can’t care that much if they don’t have a financial stake
            in the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same is true for play money vs. real money. How seriously do you
            think people are taking the game when they are playing for play
            money? The answer is not seriously at all. People will go all-in at
            crazy times and never fold because it’s just play money. They have
            nothing to lose, and they play that way. This is all well and good
            because they are having fun, but it is not a good representation of
            what things are like when you are playing for real money.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we make a big bet as a bluff and it costs our opponent $0 to call
            and see what we have, how often are they going to fold? The answer
            is probably never. If we make the same big bet as a bluff, but it
            costs our opponent $200 in real cash to call and see what we have,
            they may be much less likely to call for the heck of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point here is that what works at the play money tables is
            probably not going to work at the real money tables. Some people say
            they plan to use play money to practice before moving to real money
            and that is just a bad idea. Frankly, you’re much better off
            starting with real money and playing for super low stakes so there
            is at least something on the line and you’ll be a bit closer to how
            things will be at the higher stakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strategically speaking, people are generally going to be tighter and
            play “more correctly” when real money is on the line. In
            tournaments, they will be much more reactive to the changing stages
            of the tournament, specifically the bubble. The bigger the monetary
            difference is between cashing and not cashing, the more people are
            going to react.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a play money tournament, that difference is $0, so people aren’t
            going to care at all whether they cash or not. In a super low stakes
            tournament, that might be a few dollars which will result in some,
            but not a huge effect on players. As you move up in the real money
            stakes, that difference will increase and so will the amount that
            people react.
          </p>
          <p>
            The takeaway here is that people are going to play differently than
            they do in play money. Trying to practice and hone your skills in
            play money for a switch to real money is like trying to learn
            baseball by practicing softball. It’s similar, but the nuances are
            going to bite you in the butt when you make the switch.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"The Benefits of Real Money over Play Money"} />
          <p>
            When we’re talking about real money here, we don’t mean the highest
            stakes they have. We don’t even mean the most popular stakes. Most
            of this becomes true the second any money is put on the line. Don’t
            ever feel like you have to play higher stakes than you are
            comfortable with. Just remember that the game will change as you
            move up.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Ability to Practice Strategy Effectively"} />
          <p>
            As we’ve already beat like a dead horse, the play money tables are a
            terrible place for you to practice any sort of strategy you ever
            plan to use for real money. The only way to truly see what is going
            to work and what will not is to employ those tactics for real money.
            In a game where pressure from the fear of losing money is the
            driving force, it only works when that fear actually exists.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Ability to Make Money"} />
          <p>
            It’s pretty clear that you can’t make any money using play money.
            While you also can’t lose any money, poker is a skill game that can
            be bested by the best in the game. Most players’ ultimate goal in
            poker is to get better and be able to start making some extra money
            or possibly take things a step further and play for a living.
            Obviously, you are going to need to be playing for real money if you
            want to make that happen. Last we checked, play money chips don’t
            pay bills.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Online Poker vs Live Poker – What You Need to Know"} />
          <p>
            The above section is great for people that are already playing
            online making the switch from play money to real money. However,
            what about some of you that are making the switch from playing at
            home games or in brick and mortar casinos to the online realm? Don’t
            worry, we’re here for you and have a lot of good information that
            you need to know.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are significant differences when it comes to playing online
            poker. You may think that it’s the same game (and it technically
            is), but there are several nuances about the game that are different
            and need to be accounted for by you.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Quality vs Quantity"} />
          <p>
            Online poker players are notorious for playing multiple games at
            once. In fact, most successful players will opt to play more games
            at lower stakes to generate a higher profit. For example, let’s say
            that a player can beat $1/$2 NLH for $20 an hour when they play that
            game. That’s 10 times the big blind they win on average per hour.
            Let’s also say that if that player drops down in stakes and plays
            $0.50/$1, they can beat the game for 12 times the big blind, or $12
            an hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many online players will opt to play 2 or more tables of $0.50/$1
            where things are “easier” than the $1/$2 game. If they play the 2
            lower staked games, they will make $24 an hour as opposed to $20 an
            hour. You may ask why they just don’t play two games of $1/$2. The
            reason is that the games will be easier at the lower stakes, so they
            are able to focus less and play more games. If they are capable of
            doing so at the higher levels, they will.
          </p>
          <p>
            What does this mean for you? This means that you’re going to have
            better players playing at lower stakes online sometimes. A $1/$2
            game online can sometimes be tougher than a $1/$2 game in the casino
            or poker room. We say “sometimes” because this is always dependent
            on so many other factors.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Bigger Prize Pools"} />
          <p>
            One of the best things about playing online poker versus brick and
            mortar is that the prize pools in tournaments are typically much
            higher for much smaller buy-ins. For example, you might play in a
            live tournament at your local brick and mortar poker room for $200
            where first place is $10,000. Online, there are tournaments for $1
            that have a prize pool greater than $10,000 (sometimes by a lot).
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the technology of the internet, more people are able to
            play because the tournament is opened up to all corners of the globe
            and people don’t have to leave their homes or offices to get in on
            the action. In fact, some sites allow people to play in tournaments
            directly from their mobile phones. This results in more players in
            the tournaments and bigger prize pools which mean more money that
            you can win.
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <TextTitle title={"Lower Stakes Available"} />
          <p>
            Unless you live in the middle of nowhere or a super small town with
            a poker room, the lowest stakes you’re probably going to see in a
            brick and mortar casino or poker room is $1/$2 for most games. The
            usual buy-in for this game is $200-$300. This is sometimes A LOT
            higher than most new players would like to be playing for. Poker
            lessons can cost you stacks sometimes, and it can get too expensive
            to learn if every mistake and learning lesson costs you $200-$300 a
            pop.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Raise Sizes"} />
          <p>
            This is a small nuance but one that usually shocks anyone going from
            live poker to online poker. If you pay in a $1/$2 No Limit Hold Em
            game in your local casino, the standard raises pre-flop are usually
            all over the place. When we play, we see the standard raise being
            somewhere around 5x-7x the big blind at these games. People are
            opening the pot for $10-$14 and sometimes higher depending on the
            game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Online, this is way different. The standard opening raise is 2.5x-3x
            the big blind. Players are raising to $5-$6 pre-flop. The reason for
            this is that the players in the live setting are usually looser and
            want to play more hands (probably due to the fact they are only
            playing one table). Online, the smaller raise garners the same, if
            not more, respect than it would live.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us say this a different way to make sure it’s clear. If you
            raise to $6 pre-flop in a live casino or poker room, you are going
            to get seven or eight people calling you pre-flop. This is not
            ideal. If you raise to $6 pre-flop online, you will get only a few
            callers which is much more ideal. For this reason, pots in live
            games will be much larger and more inflated than pots at the same
            stakes online.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t really a positive or a negative; it’s just something you
            need to be aware of and adjust for.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"More Game Variations"} />
          <p>
            The chances are that if you walk into your local card room right
            now, they are spreading no limit hold em predominantly and maybe
            some pot limit Omaha and maybe some limit hold em. If you’re a
            player that likes to play some of the other poker variations like
            razz or stud, for example, you’re out of luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Online, though, they usually spread every game type you can think
            of. Now, the games might not be running all the time depending on
            how big the site is, but they at least have tables set up and ready
            to go for every variation. Usually, if a game is not running and you
            sit down, one will start up as more players see that someone is
            interested in playing a mixed game.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Online Real Money Poker Game Options"} />
          <p>
            Online poker offers the same options that you’re used to in your
            home casino or poker room, but with some added benefits. They also
            do have a few additional options that most brick and mortar casinos
            and poker rooms will not have or will only have a limited number of.
            We’re going to walk you through the different game options available
            and discuss some of the added benefits available thanks to the
            technologies of the internet.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Tournaments"} />
          <p>
            Online poker rooms offer a lot of real money tournament options. A
            poker tournament is a style of poker where participants pay a fixed
            entry fee and receive a certain amount of tournament chips. Players
            then play until one player has all of the chips. Players are not
            allowed to “cash out” and must complete the tournament. Usually, the
            top 10-15% of the field is paid money with those towards the top
            getting paid progressively more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tournaments online differ from those live in a few ways. First, the
            buy-ins are typically going to be smaller (at least in relation to
            your major $10k+ events). A major main event online might be a $200
            or $1k buy-in event, while live your main events are much more
            expensive. Now, you may be thinking this stinks in terms of the
            prize pool, but you would be wrong. Because online tournaments allow
            players from all over the world to play with much more convenience,
            the player pools get much larger which mean the prize pool does as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are weekly tournaments for $200 where you can win several
            hundred thousand dollars for first place. There are even some
            tournaments for $1 where you can win five or six figures for first!
            Yes, this means that you’re going to have to wade through a lot more
            people as the field size will be larger. But it also means that your
            risk vs. potential reward is going to be vastly different. You’ll
            have a much higher potential for reward for a much smaller risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Online poker also offers a lot of real money tournament options that
            are not available live. The reason these are not available live is
            that some of these tournament styles are logistically much more
            difficult to run in a brick and mortar setting. Online, though,
            everything is handled electronically, and the right computer systems
            can do anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, brick and mortar casinos only have a limited amount of space
            and tables to run tournaments. This means they’re going to pick the
            most popular tournament styles that draw in the most people. This
            will usually be a standard buy-in cash tournament where the winners
            are paid cash. This would be the type of poker tournament that you
            are probably most used to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some of the different special variation tournaments that
            you will probably find online. We’ve attached a very brief
            description of each to give you an idea of how each of them works.
            These are incomplete descriptions, and we recommend researching

          <TextTitle title={"Satellite Tournaments"} />
          <p>
            A satellite tournament is a smaller buy-in tournament that wins you
            entry into a larger buy-in tournament or event. For example, if you
            want to play in a $100 tournament but don’t want to spend that kind
            of money, you can play in a satellite tournament. An example of a
            satellite tournament would be 10 people playing a tournament for $10
            (total prize pool is $100), and the winner of that 10 person
            tournament gets entry into the $100 tournament.
          </p>
          <p>
            Satellites are a way for you to win your entry into bigger events
            for a smaller amount of money. Brick and mortar casinos will
            sometimes run satellites, but they will usually only be to their
            events on their property. Online, though, you have the ability to
            play satellites to their events as well as live events all over the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, interested in playing in the $10k buy-in WSOP Main
            Event but don’t have the cash and don’t live in Vegas where the
            satellites are being run? A lot of online sites will run satellites
            to this tournament that you can play from your own home. If you win
            a seat into the big game, it usually comes with travel money and
            accommodations. Satellites, as we stated, are a great way to get
            into the big action and “take your shot” without breaking the bank.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Bounty Tournaments"} />
          <p>
            A bounty tournament is one where not only do you get paid for
            finishing in the top 10-15%, but you also earn money every time that
            you knock out a player. Usually, a larger portion of your buy-in
            will go towards the prize pool, and a smaller portion will go
            towards your bounty.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if the tournament is a $20 buy-in with $5 bounties, $15
            of that will go towards the normal prize pool, and then $5 will be
            set aside for whoever knocks you out. You can end up not making the
            money in a bounty tournament but still making money!
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"All In or Fold Tournaments"} />
          <p>
            These tournaments are still somewhat rare online but are much more
            often run there than they ever are in a brick and mortar setting. In
            this format, you have two options before the flop. You can fold your
            hand, or you can go all in. This is an extremely fun format but as
            you can imagine, is a logistical nightmare to run in the brick and
            mortar setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            It requires dealers to count chip stacks every single hand and can
            take way longer than people like. Online, though, everything is done
            automatically so this style is able to run as quickly as a
            traditional tournament but still with the rush of the all in or fold
            format.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Rebuy Tournaments"} />
          <p>
            These tournaments are actually becoming rarer live as they are being
            replaced by the next format we will mention below, reentry
            tournaments. A rebuy tournament is one where you can purchase more
            chips when you are out of chips or below a certain threshold. The
            difference between this and a reentry tournament is that you stay in
            the exact same seat and are not treated as a brand new player. A lot
            of times rebuy tournaments play a lot crazier during the rebuy
            period that a normal tournament or even a re-entry tournament during
            the reentry period.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Re-entry Tournaments"} />
          <p>
            As we mentioned above, these are the tournament styles that are
            replacing rebuy tournaments in the brick and mortar setting. A
            re-entry tournament is similar to a rebuy tournament except you can
            ONLY re-enter when you have zero chips. When you choose to re-enter,
            you are treated like a brand new player and given a brand new seat
            and a brand new stack of chips. While online poker sites opt for the
            rebuy structure over the re-entry structure more, this format is
            still used a lot online.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Sit and Gos"} />
          <p>
            A sit and go is a tournament with a fixed number of players that
            does not have an official start time. The tournament starts as soon
            as enough players are registered for the event. For example, if
            there is a single table sit and go with nine seats available, the
            tournament will start as soon as nine people are registered. These
            are great if you want to play a tournament but don’t want to wait
            for a scheduled event to start.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are also great because you know how many people will be in the
            event and can better gauge how long the tournament will run. For
            example, a $10 regular (freezeout) tournament that is scheduled for
            1 pm, may get 10 players or it may get 1000 players. Because of
            this, you won’t know roughly how long the tournament might run until
            registration is closed and things have started. A nine-person sit
            and go will ONLY ever have nine players. It will NEVER have any more
            or any less than that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, these are occasionally run in brick and mortar settings but
            very rarely and with limited options. You will never find yourself a
            $5 sit and go in a poker room or casino. Online, though, you will
            have sit and gos of all levels and all game types. Most sites have
            sit and gos starting as low as $0.10.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Step Tournaments"} />
          <p>
            A step tournament is a group of sit and gos that culminate in a
            grand prize at the top that is usually an entry into a major event.
            In effect, they’re a form of satellite tournament that is run as a
            series of sit and gos. Let’s say that you want to win a $12k package
            to go play in the WSOP Main Event. The package includes your $10k
            buy-in and $2k for travel and expenses. You could play in a 10
            person $1200 sit and go where the winner gets the package. However,
            $1200 may be a bit more than you were looking to shell out for this
            shot.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where step tournaments come into play. Each step will be a
            slightly higher buy-in where the winners will win tickets to play in
            the next step up, tickets to try the same step again, tickets to a
            lower step or nada. The idea is to work your way up the steps until
            you get to the top step and ultimately win that tournament. Let’s
            look at a quick example of how the steps might be laid out for the
            above satellite to win the $12k WSOP Main Event package.
