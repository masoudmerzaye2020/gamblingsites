          <Title title={"Why Play Craps Online?"} />
          <p>
            Why is online casino gambling so popular? Why are craps players
            flocking to online casinos instead of their local casinos to play
            craps?
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our writers wrote a post some years ago about her personal
            reasons for preferring online craps, and it’s still a good read
            today.
          </p>

          <Widecard src={""} title={""} desc={""} link={""} />
          <p>
            Below, we take an objective look at some of the biggest reasons to
            play craps online.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Your Local Casino Doesn’t Have Craps"} />
          <p>
            One reason why you might opt to play craps online is because your
            local casino doesn’t offer it. Simple, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            This limits your options to either a several-hour plane or car ride
            or playing craps online. For most people, playing craps online
            allows them to play more often than they could if they had to travel
            to play.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Online Craps is Convenient"} />
          <p>Live casino gambling can be a hassle.</p>
          <p>
            You need to dress nicely. You’ll want to pull cash beforehand or
            else you’ll have to give the casino a kidney to get cash. You have
            to park and walk or pay for valet. You have to deal with hordes of
            rude and annoying people. Oh, and you’ll need to find an open craps
            table.
          </p>

          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              There is so much you must deal with when you gamble in-person. But
              you don’t have to deal with any of this when you play craps
              online. Just fire up your laptop and you’re good to go.
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>

          <TextTitle title={"Live Craps is Expensive"} />
          <p>
            There is so much you may have to spend money on when playing craps
            in a live casino.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            You don’t have to worry about those kind of costs when playing craps
            online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice we haven’t said anything about our bankroll for playing craps
            yet. This is just the money you’ll spend to put yourself in a
            position to play craps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Live craps is expensive in this regard, too. The standard minimum
            bet is $5-$10, and depending on the casino you go to, when you go,
            and the time of week and day, table minimums might be as high as $50
            or $100. Most online craps minimum bets is $1
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Online Craps is Less Hassle"} />
          <p>
            Las Vegas is one of the most popular vacation destinations in the
            world because the casino resort properties are truly spectacular.
            There are multiple restaurants, shops, nightclubs, pools, spas, and
            every gambling option under the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, there are hassles when you go to any brick-and-mortar
            casino.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conditions can be smoky, and this can get intense when the casino is
            crowded. It’s also tough to find an open spot at a craps table when
            it’s busy.
          </p>
          <p>
            People are not always on their best behavior when they’re drunk and
            losing money either, which will take its toll on you. And then there
            is the price gouging for food and drinks that are not comped.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are just a few of the many annoyances you avoid when you play
            craps online from home instead of in-person.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"No Etiquette, No Problem"} />
          <p>
            One concern craps beginners have is making a fool of themselves at
            the craps table due to breaching any unspoken rules or etiquette.
          </p>
          <p>You don’t have to worry about that when you play online.</p>

          {/* leave the table */}

          <TextTitle title={"Play Craps for Free"} />
          <p>
            Yes, you are here to learn about playing craps for real money, but
            wouldn’t you rather have the option of playing for free when you
            want? That’s possible online.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are benefits to playing craps for free that are worth
            considering.
          </p>

          <p>
            Obviously, the goal is to play craps online for real cash, but it’s
            a good idea to know when to use free craps games strategically.
            Doing so can actually help you win more money at the craps tables in
            the long run.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another reason to play craps online is to claim casino bonuses and
            promotions. Online casinos offer several types of promotions,
            depending on whether you’re a new or existing customer. We look at
            these in more detail in the following section.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Bonuses for Online Craps"} />
          <div>
            <Cornerimage
              src={"/image/realmoney/Real-Money-Craps-Bonuses.jpg"}
            />
            <p>
              One of the biggest advantages of playing craps online is the
              bonuses you can claim at most casinos and gambling sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bonuses can have a huge impact on your long-term results when
              gambling online, especially when it comes to casino games, so you
              should always try to take full advantage of every promotion for
              some extra cash.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s take a look at some of the most widely available bonuses at
              online craps casinos.
            </p>
          </div>

          <TextTitle title={"First Deposit Bonuses"} />
          <p>
            The competition between the hundreds of casinos on the web is
            fierce. They try hard to attract new customers, and that works in
            favor of the players. Almost all of them offer large welcome bonuses
            for signing up and making a deposit.
          </p>
          <p>
            First deposit bonuses are the most common bonuses available online.
            They’re typically the biggest, too. To claim these, you need to
            register as a new player and fund your account with a little money.
          </p>
          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              You can often double or even triple your initial cash investment,
              even before you have played a single game of craps!
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>
          <p>
            It’s important to read the fine print, though, as there are certain
            conditions attached. For a start, you need to find out about the
            wagering requirements. The casinos will expect you to clear every
            bonus prior to withdrawal and it’s essential to understand if
            playing craps is part of the promotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that’s not the case, you might be forced to play other games
            which might not be ideal. Make sure the first-deposit bonus you
            claim can be used to play craps and be prepared to meet the wagering
            requirements.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"No Deposit Bonuses"} />
          <p>
            A few of the top real money craps casinos offer no deposit bonuses.
            As the name suggests, you don’t have to add your own funds to claim
            them. They represent an excellent opportunity to build a bankroll
            from scratch.
          </p>
          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              Your chances of profiting from no deposit bonuses are usually
              slim, but you get to play craps for real money online without
              risking anything!
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>
          <p>
            Play it smart, have some fun, and if you’re lucky enough, you might
            get yourself a nice treat from thin air.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Reload Bonuses"} />
          <p>
            Our recommended online casinos for craps won’t forget you once the
            welcome bonus is done. They take care of their regular customers as
            well as new ones, by offering them various ways to keep earning
            extra value. One of the most common deals are reload bonuses.
          </p>
          <p>
            They work similarly to the first-deposit bonuses in the sense that
            you need to fund your account to get them and you have to clear them
            by playing. The terms are usually worse than the welcome offer at
            most gambling sites, but you still get something extra which is
            always good.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <Title title={"Mobile Craps for Money"} />
          <p>
            The short duration of every round and the thrilling experience make
            real money online craps an excellent choice for mobile gambling. Our
            trusted craps casinos give you the option to enjoy the tables on all
            popular devices such as iPhone, iPad, Android, and Windows Phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can do that directly from their mobile-responsive sites. Thanks
            to the rise of HTML5, the pages adjust to your device almost
            instantly, so the performance and the graphics are impressive.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, you could also download a real money casino app for
            even higher quality. The process usually takes just a few minutes
            and you can play craps (and other games) on all sorts of phones and
            tablets.

            <p>
              Craps is the undisputed king of dice games, there is no doubt
              about that. It is a rich history, it’s widely available, and
              people love many different aspects of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, craps is not the ONLY dice gambling game that you’ll find
              at the leading real money casinos online. In fact, there are
              several alternatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are a couple of examples of some alternatives to craps. If
              you enjoy playing craps, there’s an excellent chance that you’ll
              also enjoy these.
            </p>
          </div>

          <TextTitle title={"Sic Bo"} />
          <p>
            The roots of gambling in China can be traced back thousands of years
            ago, so it’s hardly a surprise that the region has produced plenty
            of dice games. Those of you who like to play real money craps should
            certainly try Sic Bo.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find it at many of our top online craps casinos and while it
            looks complicated at the first glance, it’s a lot of fun once you
            get used to it. There are so many wagers here that you can spend
            hours without getting bored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The house edge varies greatly depending on the bets you place. It’s
            as low as 3% for the best options and goes over 10% for the worst.
            That’s why it’s a good idea to prepare before playing Sic Bo. Our
            guide below can certainly help in that regard.
          </p>

          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center">
            <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Real Money Sic Bo"} />

          <TextTitle title={"Klondike"} />
          <p>
            If the large number of betting options in craps is a little
            overwhelming for you, and you prefer a simpler dice game, Klondike
            is certainly one of the best choices. It’s not as popular as craps,
            but it’s still available at some of the top online casino sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both the player and the dealer roll five dice. There are five
            possible combinations, starting from a pair and going to five of a
            kind. You can place a wager on whether your combination will be
            stronger than the dealer or vice versa.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are various side bets in the different versions of the game,
            but the core of Klondike remains similar. It doesn’t have the same
            variety as craps but that could be seen as an advantage by some
            players.

          <p>
            If you are not too interested in other games, you can play craps
            online for real money and still enjoy some variety thanks to the
            different versions of the game.
          </p>

            The best casinos for real money craps usually offer at least a few
            tables with alternative rule sets.

            Let’s take a look at the most popular ones, so you’ll know what to
            expect.

          <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Bank Craps"} />
          <p className="py-2 ml-4">
            Arguably the most widespread variant of the game is called bank
            craps. It’s what you’ll find in most of the top craps sites and
            land-based casinos.
          </p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Crapless Craps"} />
          <p className="py-2 ml-4">
            One of the best versions for players is Crapless Craps. You can’t
            lose a pass line wager if the roll of the dice is 2, 3, or 12. That
            dramatically reduces the house edge which is the reason why some
            real money online craps casinos don’t offer it.
          </p>
          <Mainbullet link={""} desc={"Simplified Craps"} />
          <p className="py-2 ml-4">
            Some people who play craps online for cash don’t like the many bets
            available and the complex layout of the table. If you are part of
            this group, you should try Simplified Craps. As the name implies,
            it’s a simpler version of the game. You’ll find it at several of the
            leading real money craps sites.
