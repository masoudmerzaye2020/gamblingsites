          <p>If you’re currently deciding where to play online blackjack for real money, you genuinely can’t go wrong with any of our recommended casinos. Our team consists of genuine experts in online gambling for real money. We’ve been recommending casinos and betting sites to our readers for years.</p>
          <p>If you are somewhat skeptical about our claims, we salute you! That’s how you should be on the internet, especially when it comes to putting real cash at risk. We’re not really here to convince you of anything, though. We provide information and advice in good faith and it’s up to you how you use it.</p>
          <p>What we’ll do now is explain a little more about how our team selects the best online casinos for real money blackjack, and some details of what you can expect from these gambling sites. From there, it’s your decision as to whether you sign up with any of them.</p>

          <Title title={'Rating Online Casinos for Real Money Blackjack'}/>
          <div>
            {/* iamge */}
            <p>With so many blackjack casinos on the internet, ranking the best of the bunch is not an easy task. It requires a team of experts who know the online gambling industry as a whole, and have experience in playing blackjack.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, that’s exactly what we have at our disposal. Members of our team have been playing blackjack online for real money for years. Most of them have played the game in “real” casinos for even longer.</p>
            <p>In short, we know what to look for when rating online casinos for real money blackjack. Here’s how the whole process goes.</p>
          </div>

          <TextTitle title={'Step 1: Background Check'}/>
          <p>There are a few basics we want to know before we actually sign up at with an online casino and start testing it. We’re only interested in legitimate casinos that we know can be trusted, so we start with some initial research.</p>
          <p>We check the company behind the site, the people involved, the gambling licenses they have, and other important factors. If we’re satisfied with what we find, we move on to the next step.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Step 2: Sign Up and Deposit'}/>
          <p>Once we know an online casino is legit, we sign up and make a deposit.</p>
          <p>This helps us test how easy the process is and check what banking options are available. Then we have the funds available to start playing the real money online blackjack games.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Step 3: Test the Blackjack Games'}/>
          <p>This stage is our favorite and for a good reason. We test all the real money blackjack tables on multiple devices in order to see how good they are.</p>
          <p>This one is about having fun and evaluating the variety of options, the house edge, the flexibility of the stakes, and other important factors.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Step 4: Talk to the Support'}/>
          <p>Here we contact the casino’s customer support team to see how easy it is to get some help and whether the staff are competent enough to offer useful assistance.</p>
          <p>Many people underestimate the importance of good customer service when gambling online for real money. We don’t. We make sure that you’re not going to have deal with rude or unhelpful people when you experience an issue.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Step 5: Make a Withdrawal'}/>
          <p>A lot of real money online casinos with blackjack perform perfectly well up to this point. But nothing that’s gone before is that important if you can’t get your hands on your winnings. That’s why we request a cashout to see how it goes.</p>
          <p>If a gambling site does not offer fast payouts with minimum fuss, you won’t see it in our rankings of the top real money blackjack sites. In fact, you won’t see it ANY of our rankings.</p>

          <p>As you can see, our review process covers pretty much all the important aspects of playing blackjack for real money online. We go through the same steps that any player would face, to help us identify the strengths and weaknesses of each online casino.</p>
          <p>In the next section, we reveal more about what we expect to see from the best real money blackjack online casinos.</p>

            <p>Going through the whole process of joining and testing a casino is only useful if you know what to look for. Our team certainly delivers on that front.</p>
            <p>We make sure we carefully evaluate the factors that matter to players. When it comes to playing online real money blackjack, these are some of the most important things we look for.</p>

          <p>Most of these are pretty self-explanatory, but let’s take a deeper look. Then you’ll know exactly what you should expect from the top online casinos for real money blackjack.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Good Selection of Real Money Blackjack Games'}/>
          <p>The popularity of blackjack forces most online casinos to offer the game, but not all of them are happy about it. Let’s not forget that this is one of the casino games that has a very low house edge.</p>
          <p>The best online casinos for real money blackjack, however, embrace the game completely. They offer a good selection of games with means more tables and plenty of variety.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Wide Range of Banking Options'}/>
          <p>It’s no good joining one of the top blackjack casinos only to find that you can’t get any cash online. That’s why it’s important to choose one that offers a number of different banking options.</p>
          <p>Our recommendations all work with several different payment methods. These include credit and debit cards, e-wallets, wire transfers, and even Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
          <p>The full range of options at your disposal depends on the specific casino and your country of residence, but you should be able to use something that suits.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Fast Payouts'}/>
          <p>Nobody wants to wait for their money for too long and that won’t be the case if you decide to sign up at one of our trusted casino sites for blackjack. They all have respectable withdrawal times that are as low as a day or two for certain payment options.</p>
          <p>Even if you use one of the slower banking methods, you should still get your money within just a few working days.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Compatibility With Mobile Devices'}/>
          <p>Many people these days want to play real money blackjack online from their mobile devices. That’s why we test our recommended casinos from different smartphones and tablets such as iPhones, iPads, and various Android devices.</p>
          <p>Whether it’s through a native app or using mobile-responsive sites, the best online casinos for blackjack run smoothly on all the top devices.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Generous Bonuses and Promotions'}/>
          <p>Blackjack is not the best casino game for bonuses and promotions. The low house edge means that many gambling sites are reluctant to give you too much extra cash on top. This means you will often find blackjack excluded from many promotions.</p>
          <p>That’s not the case with the best real money blackjack online casinos that we recommend. At least some of their bonuses include blackjack, even if they come with higher wagering requirements than some other games.</p>
          <p>You will also often find exclusive promotions like blackjack tournaments and leaderboards, so there are always ways to extract additional value.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Flexible Stakes on the Blackjack Tables'}/>
          <p>We know that some of our readers just want to have fun without risking too much of their cash. Others take their play very seriously and are looking to play blackjack for high stakes. The top online blackjack casinos are more than happy to welcome both groups and anything in between.</p>
          <p>They usually work with flexible stakes that start really low and go all the way up to thousands of dollars per hand.</p>

          <Title title={'Popular Real Money Blackjack Games'}/>
          <div>
            {/* image */}
            <p>There are several reasons why blackjack is such a popular game for real money gambling. One major one is that learning how to play blackjack is really quite straightforward. There aren’t that many rules and they’re relatively easy to pick up.</p>
            <p>Another reason people love the game is the variety that it offers. There are many different blackjack variants, each of which offers some kind of unique twist on the traditional version of the game.</p>
            <p>Most of the leading real money blackjack casinos that we recommend offer at least a few of these variants. Here are some of the most common.</p>
          </div>

          <TextTitle title={'Classic Blackjack'}/>
          <p>Arguably the most popular version of the game is classic blackjack, sometimes called American blackjack. This has the simplest set of rules and is available at almost every real money online casino.</p>
          <p>Some of the rules can vary a little, such as whether the dealer hits or stands on soft seventeen and how many decks are used, but the fundamentals remain the same.</p>
          <TextTitle title={'European Blackjack'}/>
          <p>European blackjack is also widely available at online casino sites. Many of the rules are the same as classic blackjack, with a few notable exceptions.</p>
          <p>For example, the you can only split your cards once. You can also only double down on values of 9, 10, and 11.</p>
          <p>Another key difference is that players take their actions before the dealer receives their second card. This means the dealer cannot peek for a blackjack, which increases the house edge.</p>
          <p>While the difference might seem small, we advise you to stick to the classic variation or other real money online blackjack games with a lower house edge.</p>
          <p>It’s fair to say that most of the top casino websites for blackjack have more lucrative variants than the European version.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Blackjack Switch'}/>
          <p>Blackjack Switch is an entertaining version of the game with a really clever twist. It’s available at most of the best online casinos for blackjack and has become very popular in recent years.</p>
          <p>The big change here is that you are dealt two hands at the same time and you can swap cards between them to get the best combination.</p>
          <p>However, many other rules are against the player to make up for that, so there’s no huge difference in the house edge. The fun aspect of Blackjack Switch is the main benefit of this game.</p>

          <TextTitle title={'Other Blackjack Variants'}/>
          <p>Almost all of the top real money blackjack casinos online offer at least five or six different variants of the game, so we won’t get into all of them. Here’s a short list of the some of the other most commonly found ones, though.</p>

          <div>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Super Fun 21'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Caribbean 21'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Face Up 21'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Spanish 21'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Double Exposure Blackjack'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Lucky 13s'}/>
          </div>
          <p>Most of those have sub-variants with single and multiple decks or hands, so the overall variety of blackjack games online is truly staggering. And we haven’t even mentioned what is fast becoming THE most popular way to play real money blackjack online. Let’s take a look at that now.</p>

          <Title title={'Live Dealer Blackjack at Online Casinos'}/>
          <p>Many fans of blackjack love the experience of playing the games in land-based casinos. The chips, the cards, the interaction with the dealers and the other players all contribute to the whole experience.</p>
          <p>It’s hard to recreate that experience when you play real money blackjack online, even at the top casino sites. And yet, there is one option that combines the most appealing traits of both worlds.</p>
          <p>Thanks to ever-evolving technologies, you can now play blackjack online for money online with live dealers. With the use of video streaming you get to play with a real dealer, using real cards and chips</p>
