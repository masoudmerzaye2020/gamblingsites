</p>
            <p>Here’s what you need to do know.</p>
            <TextTitle title={'General Rules of Pai Gow Poker'}/>
            <p>Pai Gow poker is a game that uses a standard 52-card deck with one joker included. Here are the rules for play.</p>
            <p>First, you and the dealer will each get seven cards. Some online casinos allow you to play with other people on the same table, but everyone still competes direct with the dealer.</p>
            <p>You have to divide your seven cards into two separate hands. You will have a five-card high hand and a two-card low hand. The cards must be divided to where the high hand is better than the low hand.</p>
            <p>For instance, you can have a low hand of two sixes, but your high hand must be worth something better.</p>
            <p>The joker works as any card, so you can use this well when dictating whatever you want to get out of your hand. The dealer will then reveal one’s cards and the hands that the person uses. You will win or lose based on the results.</p>
            <p></p>

            <TextTitle title={'What Are the Results?'}/>
            <p>One of four results will occur in a real money Pai Gow poker round.</p>

            </div>
            <p>You’ll with the value of your original bet if you are successful, although you may have to pay a commission.

</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Commission in Real Money Pai Pow'}/>
            <p>Some real money Pai Gow tables feature a commission. The casino takes a small percentage of the player’s winnings after a hand.</p>
            <p>This commission may also come out of anything returned to the player if a push occurs.

</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Pai Gow Side Bets'}/>
            <p>Most of the payouts you’ll find when you play Pai Gow for real money online are 1:1 totals, but you can win more cash if you have a straight or better and you place a side bet.</p>
            <p>Side bets are available on most tables at Pai Gow online casinos. The payouts these games provide for side bet wins vary at different casino sites, though.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Commission-Free Pai Gow'}/>
            <p>In a commission-free Pai Gow game, the casino does not take out any commissions from whatever you win. But there are other rules that make up for this.</p>
            <p>For instance, you might have to automatically push your bet if the dealer’s low hand has a nine or higher.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Insurance Pai Gow'}/>
            <p>An insurance Pai Gow game allows you to place a side bet that a non-winning hand will appear. You could get a higher payout if you have a hand with an ace as the high card but with no pairs, flushes, or straights.</p>
            <p>The total payout could be even higher if you have a nine or lower as the most valuable card and no other features that can make up a hand.</p>

            <Title title={'Real Money Pai Gow on Mobile'}/>
            <p>Some of the top real money Pai Gow sites offer mobile games. This mean you can play online Pai Gow for real cash using your smartphone, tablet, or other mobile device.</p>

            <p>You can then use the mobile interface to select your wagers and how you will play with your cards. The interface is essentially the same as what you’d find on desktop Pai Gow sites, just a bit smaller.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Tri-Card Poker'}/>
