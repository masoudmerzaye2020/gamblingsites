          <p>
            Did you know that some real money online casinos charge a fee when
            making a deposit, while others don’t? Or that some casinos payout
            your winnings the same day, while others take weeks to pay?
          </p>
          <p>
            The point is that there’s a big difference between the best sites
            and the rest. Finding the best places to play real money casino
            games online isn’t easy, but we’re here to help. We have an
            effective system for reviewing, rating, and ranking casino sites to
            produce the most accurate results.
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn’t matter if you’re brand new to playing casino games online
            or you’ve been playing for years. Either way, you should be looking
            for 2022’s best real money casinos. These are the sites that will
            give you the best experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            When compiling our rankings, we go well beyond the surface and
            explore all aspects of each site. We consider the games they offer,
            their banking methods, bonuses and promotions, and even the site’s
            terms and conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond that, we expect every real money casino online to take care
            of its customers. So, we search forums and review sites to find
            feedback from people who have used the site. Then, we test the site
            ourselves to make sure the site lives up to its reputation.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are ready to get started, click one of the sites above to
            begin immediately. Or keep reading our online casino real money
            guide to learn more.

          <Title title={"Comparing the Top Real Money Online Casino Sites"} />
          <p>
            You probably noticed that we recommend several different sites
            instead of declaring that one site as the absolute best. That is
            because we know that different players have different preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have already done the research to ensure that our recommended
            sites offer the best experience. So how are you supposed to choose
            between them? The best way is to compare several sites based on
            various criteria. Then you will be able to see the most important
            factors at a glance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is an example of how we compared some of our recommended sites.
            You can create a table similar to this based on the sites that you
            are most interested in.
          </p>

          {/* table here */}
          <p>
            Once you have your preferred sites organized like this, it is easy
            to see which ones stand out in the areas that matter to you. From
            there, you should be able to narrow down your list to the two or
            three sites that you are most interested in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that you can always create multiple casino accounts.
            Creating multiple accounts allows you to have more access to games,
            and you can collect more casino bonuses.
          </p>

          <Title title={"What Makes a Real Money Casino Legitimate in 2022?"} />

          <p>
            When you’re ready to play some online casino games for real money,
            you’ve got options. So, it doesn’t make any sense to settle for
            things you don’t want when you can have it all by choosing the right
            site.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you haven’t accessed many online casinos for real money gaming,
            you may not even know what you’re looking for, at least not at
            first. But there are a few key components that, above all else,
            ensure that you will have a top-notch experience with safe, secure,
            and fair gaming. That’s ultimately what everyone wants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some of the non-negotiable factors we look for when ranking
            and reviewing the best online casinos for real money.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Safety and Security"} />
          <p>
            Safety is our number one priority, and it should be yours too. That
            is especially true when you use a casino online for real money
            games.
          </p>
          <p>
            One indicator of whether a site is safe or not is its gambling
            license. Therefore, we only recommend sites that hold a legitimate
            license for the type of gaming that they offer. It is also important
            to consider the licensing authority. For example, the Malta Gaming
            Authority has more strict standards than many other organizations.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Fast Deposits and Payouts"} />
          <p>
            If you can’t move cash into your account, then you’re already out of
            the game. Maybe even more important, though, is knowing that you’ll
            be paid after you’ve accumulated your big winnings.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, banking is one of the most critical aspects of the best online
            casinos for real money gaming..
          </p>
          <p>
            An ideal scenario is a variety of deposit and payout options,
            suitable for the players’ geographical locations. All transactions
            should be fee-free with low minimum requirements, and fast payouts
            are essential.
          </p>
          {/* double border box */}

          <TextTitle title={"Reputation and Customer Service"} />
          <p>
            Transparency is the name of the game when you’re deciding where to
            play casino games online for real money. If you pull up a website
            and you don’t see prominently posted customer service information or
            verification of fair gaming certification, then it should be a red
            flag.
          </p>
          <p>
            The RNG certification should be on the homepage, as well as a link
            to 24/7 customer service.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll notice that the modern sites we recommend take transparency
            much more seriously than they did a few years ago when you had to
            play Where’s Waldo to find certification. This is especially true
            for American players.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Casino Game Selection"} />
          <p>
            Have you ever noticed that recommendations for where to play slots
            online typically mention the software used? It’s highly unusual in
            any other industry. But it’s the software that determines what games
            can be offered to players.
          </p>

          {/* dobble border box */}

          <p>
            At the best sites, you can expect to find slot banks with at least
            100 titles, a variety of video poker games, as well as blackjack,
            roulette, baccarat, and poker. Adding a live dealer casino provider
            is also beneficial and adds to the overall service.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Cash Bonuses and Promotions"} />
          <p>
            Bonuses and promotions go hand in hand with online casinos and real
            money gambling. There are few ways to incentivize online players, so
            deposit bonuses and free spins serve as the primary awards and
            enticements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most sites offer a generous welcome bonus that promises to match
            your first deposit. Each site has a different match percentage and
            maximum bonus amounts. They should also have a variety of bonuses
            that are available for returning customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, biggest is not ALWAYS best when it comes to casino bonuses.
            The terms and conditions, such as playthrough requirements, affect
            how a good a bonus really is. Make sure you think through all of
            those requirements before you claim online casino real money
            bonuses.
          </p>
          <TextTitle title={"Mobile Casino App"} />
          <p>
            Mobile compatibility is non-negotiable in today’s world. So, we
            expect the best sites to offer their services on a high-quality
            casino app. You shouldn’t have to sacrifice quality just because you
            want to play real money online casino games from your phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some sites have prioritized their mobile gambling product, even
            offering some games that don’t pop up on the desktop version. Other
            sites offer additional bonuses for mobile users.
          </p>
          <p>
            You typically don’t need to download anything from the Apple or
            Google Play store, either, as most mobile casinos can be accessed
            directly through your internet browser.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"How We Rank and Review Online Casinos"} />
          <p>
            These factors are just some of the criteria that we look for before
            we decide to recommend any particular casino. We actually have a
            whole team of experts who work together to research, test, review
            and rank various sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team and our process set us apart from other recommendation
            sites. We really go the extra mile to make sure every site we
            recommend is up to our high standards. Here are some of the steps we
            take to ensure our rankings and reviews are accurate.
          </p>

          <Mainbullet
            link=""
            title="Extensive Research – Every site we recommend has been thoroughly researched. We look for customer reviews, up-to-date licensing information, and details about the company that operates each site."

            Knowing all of this information about how we do things here might
            not matter to some people. But we think it is essential that you
            know why you can trust our recommendations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our extensive process goes far beyond what any of our competitors
            are willing to do. More importantly, we focus on the things that
            matter to customers instead of which sites are willing to pay the
            most for a good review.

          <Title title={"Real Money Online Casino Games"} />
          <Wideimage src={""} />
          <p>
            When it comes to the availability of casino games online for real
            money, you can expect a virtual translation of what you’ll find in a
            typical brick-and-mortar casino. But you will have even more
            options.
          </p>
          <p>
            Table games are close replications with similar limits, side bets,
            and gameplay. Slots are also similar but, with a few exceptions,
            online slot providers have different titles than what you’ll find on
            a land-based casino floor.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Real Money Slots"} />
          <p>
            It’s the number one game, whether you’re playing slots online or in
            person. By their nature, slots provide the most variety. Developers
            have all kinds of flexibility with the stakes, paylines, features,
            themes, and bonus rounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, unlike a casino game such as roulette, variations are virtually
            limitless. Slots are also popular because there’s no learning curve.
            You can pull up any game, press spin, and you’re in it to win it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we’ve moved on from the original reel-based games to video
            slots, the format easily transitions from an in-person machine to a
            digital platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leading casinos provide at least 100 slot games, although you
            may come across some that could exceed 1,000, depending on licensing
            and regulation. Most sites also offer exciting progressive jackpot
            slots.
          </p>

          <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Online Slots"} />
          <TextTitle title={"Real Money Blackjack"} />
          <p>
            Slots are number one when compared to other machine-based games,
            like video poker or keno. In the table games realm, that top spot
            goes to blackjack. The best sites have plenty of variations on the
            game of 21.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as you’d find in brick and mortars, blackjack games online come
            in different versions like Pontoon, Face-Up, and Perfect Pairs.
          </p>
          <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Online Slots"} />

          <TextTitle title={"Real Money Roulette"} />
          <p>
            American or European, it doesn’t matter what your preference is, as
            you’re sure to find a few roulette tables in most online casinos.
            Most US-focused casinos stick with the American version, but that’s
            not always the case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Roulette can be categorized differently, depending on your preferred
            site. While most include multiple selections in the table games
            area, if you come up short there, check out the Specialty Games
            section, and you should hit the roulette jackpot.
          </p>
          <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Online Slots"} />

          <TextTitle title={"Real Money Video Poker"} />
          <p>
            Some casino sites neglect video poker and may only offer a few
            single-hand options. But the best sites will have an assortment for
            devoted video poker players. They’ll include some multi-hand games,
            as well as unique twists, such as Pyramid Poker or European Slot
            Poker.
          </p>
          <p>
            Video poker should have a dedicated area on the virtual casino
            floor. But you’ll sometimes find that it’s hidden inside the
            Specialty Games area, like roulette.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Live Dealer Games for Money"} />
          <p>
            The best sites also include a dedicated live dealer casino. Even
            though it may have the same types of betting opportunities as the
            primary table games area, the live dealer casino experience is quite
            different because it features a live-streamed video of a human
            dealer. You get to see the dealer pull the cards from the shoe or
            spin the roulette wheel on your screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most live dealer casinos will focus on standard games of blackjack,
            baccarat, and roulette. But you’ll find that the top casinos in 2022
            go above and beyond. Croupiers are now hosting table poker, as well
            as proprietary games.
          </p>
          <Bluebutton link={""} title={"Online Slots"} />
          <p>
            We’ve mentioned a few of the top games, you will find many other
            options on most sites. Here are a few other games that you might
            enjoy.

          <p>
            Banking is one of the most crucial aspects of playing casino games
            online for real money. As we mentioned earlier, without access to a
            proper financial menu, you might as well just move on and find
            another option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Above all else, figuring out how to move cash in and out of a casino
            is the most significant challenge, particularly if you’re a
            beginner.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Evaluating Your Banking Options"} />
          <p>
            Before you register a new player’s account, we advise that you look
            through the deposit and withdrawal options to make sure that it
            suits your needs. What you’re specifically searching for includes
            the following.

          <p>
            The following are the most common banking methods used by online
            casinos.
          </p>

          {/*  leave the bellow  up to real money casino appss */}

          <Title title={"Real Money Casino Apps"} />
          <p>
            A few years ago, not that many of even the most reputable online
            casinos were great for mobile play. But, it’s 2022, and mobile
            access to everything is a priority, and that includes gambling.
            Casino apps are far more widely available now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that doesn’t mean that you’ll head to the Apple store to find an
            official app for every online casino. If a site doesn’t have a
            native app approved in the Apple or Google Play store, it has a
            responsive app. These are typically compatible with iPhones, Android
            phones, and all kinds of other mobile devices.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"No App Store Required"} />
          <p>
            Responsive apps are mobile versions of the full desktop operation.
            Until recently, they had small buttons, barely readable text, and
            were frustrating to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, these days, the top casinos have top-notch smartphone
            representations. Hamburger menus open to reveal bonuses, banking,
            registration, and everything else you’ll find on the full site.
            Gaming software prioritizes mobile play with oversized graphics and
            buttons. No magnifying glass required.
          </p>

          {/* mobile image */}

          <TextTitle title={"Mobile Browsing"} />
          <p>
            To access a mobile-responsive casino app, type the website address
            into your mobile browser. You can register a new account, or log in
            to your existing one, and get the ball rolling. It is a good idea to

            Top online casinos will also have the best mobile counterparts. They
            may not have small icons in the Apple store, but they’ll get the job
            done with responsive casino apps.

            We’ve got an entire section dedicated to the best real money casino
            apps that are as convenient to pull up, as your favorite mobile
            gambling site.

            We like to look at the glass as half full and focus on the best
            places to play online casino games for real money. But reality
            bites, and there are some gambling sites that, unfortunately, make
            the naughty list.
          </p>

            During our review, rating, and ranking process, we occasionally come
            across some sites that you should avoid at all costs. Here are a few
            examples.

            Whether they’re slow to pay, just refuse to pay, or have other
            issues like changing their terms and conditions without notice or
            unfair gaming practices, one problem is enough to place an operator
            on our “no” list.

            That doesn’t mean that a site can’t redeem itself. But what you’ll
            find if you look through our blacklist page is that there are trends
            that tie into ownership. So, instead of an issue with just one
            casino, there are usually problems with all sites under a single
            umbrella.

            our online casino blacklist before you register a player’s account.
