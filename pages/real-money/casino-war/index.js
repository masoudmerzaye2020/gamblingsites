            <TextTitle title={'The Rules of Casino War'}/>
            <p>You should obviously know the rules before you start playing real money Casino War games. Luckily, they’re very straightforward. Here’s a quick rundown.</p>
            <p>The game entails six 52-card decks, with each of the cards ranked in the same way as what you’d see in a poker match. The ace has the highest value.</p>
            <p>The game runs as follows.

</p>
            <div>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Both you and the dealer will receive a card. The values between the two cards are compared with one another. Whoever has the higher-value card will win the bet. The suits will not be a factor.'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'You’ll have the option to surrender or go to war if the two cards result in a tie. You can surrender to lose half your bet, or you can go to war and double the stake.'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'The dealer will then clear three cards from the deck before dealing again.'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'You will win the original amount of the wager if your card is higher than the dealer’s, but you will also lose the total overall wager if the dealer wins. You will win the doubled wager if the two cards remain equal.'}/>
            </div>
            <p>You can also employ a side bet when playing Casino War for money. You can bet that the draw will end in a tie.</p>
            <p>The total amount of money that you get from these side bets varies at different gambling websites. Most of the payouts are 1:1, but you could get a 2:1 payout if you win after a tie or you tie the dealer a second time.</p>

            <p>There are many good reasons why you should consider playing real money Casino War online instead of in a land-based casino. Here are a few of them.</p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'You won’t have any pressure from other players at the same time. You’re making decisions for yourself and in your own time.'}/>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'You can play online Casino War for real money while spending less on each hand. The table minimum at most online casinos us less than at a physical casino.'}/>

            <Title title={'Mobile Real Money Casino War'}/>

            <Title title={'Similar Games to Casino War'}/>
            <p>While it is fun to play Casino War for real money online, it’s also good to mix things up. Most gambling sites offer a wide variety of casino games, and many of them are also worth taking a look at.

</p>
            <p>Here are a few games you can play online that are very similar to Casino War.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Baccarat'}/>
            <p>Baccarat is one of the most popular traditional games you’ll find on casino sites. The game also entails a comparison of cards between the player and the dealer or banker. Both sides get two cards, and whoever has a hand that comes the closest to nine points is the winner. The first digit is always dropped when the total is ten or higher.</p>
            <p>Baccarat is different in that you can bet on either the player or the banker side. The point comes from the player and banker sides working with different rules for play. The banker has a greater chance of winning on average, but not by much.</p>

            <div className='flex flex-wrap justify-center'>
                <Bluebutton link={''} title={'Real Money Baccrat'}/>
            </div>

            <TextTitle title={'Red Dog'}/>
            <p>Red Dog is another game similar to Casino War for how it focuses on cards that come within certain totals. A dealer will play two cards. You then have to predict if the third card the dealer plays is in between the two in value. The payout will be higher if the margin between those two cards is smaller. You’d have to look at the possible odds for something coming up before you make your bet on whatever might work.

</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Hi-Lo'}/>
            <p>Casino Hi-Lo is a straightforward game that you might find on sites that offer online Casino War for money. In Hi-Lo you are dealt a single card. You then pick whether the next card that appears is higher or lower than that total.

</p>
            <p>Hi-Low is simple, but the totals you could win might change depending on the initial card. You might have greater odds if there’s a ten and you pick the next card to be higher, for example.</p>
            <p>Some tables will also let you play with multiple cards going against whatever the dealer brings out. Prop bets may also be available with some of these games, although the rules for play will vary over the site you choose.</p>
