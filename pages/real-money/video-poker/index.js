</p>

            <Title title={'Ranking Video Poker Online Casinos'}/>
            <div>
                <Cornerimage src={'/image/realmoney/Video-Poker-Online-Casinos.png'}/>
                <p>There is naturally going to be a certain reluctance when it comes to stepping into uncharted waters and depositing cash into an online video poker account. This is understandable; you have to be discerning whenever you conduct business online.</p>
                <p>We take all relevant factors into account when we evaluate online video poker casinos. It’s not easy to get our stamp of approval, which is why you can expect to be treated right at all the sites we listed above.</p>
            </div>

            <TextTitle title={'Licensed Online Casinos'}/>
            <p>You may assume that online casinos with video poker conduct business without any government oversight. This is simply not the case, because they have personnel and infrastructure in a physical location.</p>
            <p>They are generating revenue, so they have tax responsibilities. Plus, countries and territorial jurisdictions do not allow unregulated companies to run amok with impunity.</p>
            <Borderedbox>
                <p>Legitimate video poker casino sites carry licenses that have been issued by well-known, trustworthy jurisdictions. Applicants must jump through many hoops, and they have to come up with six figure licensing fees.</p>
            </Borderedbox>
            <p>We all deal with companies that do business online every day, either directly or indirectly. Online gambling is a completely accepted industry all around the world, and the real money casinos we approved above are legit in every way.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Efficient Transactions'}/>
            <p>At the end of the day, real money online video poker is all about the Benjamins.</p>
            <p>Deposit and withdrawal methods are key, and the top video poker casinos make it relatively easy to fund your account and initiate payouts.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Video Poker Bonuses'}/>
            <p>Online video poker casinos often offer signup bonuses, though they are hit and miss for video poker players, as video poker has a much lower house edge compared to other casino games.</p>
            <p>The online casinos we feel comfortable recommending offer generous deposit bonuses for video poker players, with reasonable rollover requirements and other terms and conditions.</p>

            <TextTitle title={'Availability of Customer Service'}/>
            <p>These real money video poker casinos  place an emphasis on the customer experience. Just like any business, they want to satisfy the people who visit to engender loyalty.</p>
            <p>Empowered customer service agents can be reached over the phone, email, and live chat.

</p>

            <Title title={'Why Play Real Money Video Poker Online?'}/>
            <p>If you have access to a brick and mortar casino that offers video poker, depending on the venue, it can be fun to make the trip from time to time. This being stated, you’re making a time commitment, and most people don’t take drives to casinos in the spur of the moment.</p>
            <p>When you think about the game of video poker, it’s generated by computer software. A casino is simply a repository of individual terminals that are running programs that could potentially be accessed from anywhere in the world.</p>
            <p>Unless you really enjoy the experience at a particular casino, why go anywhere when you can play online video poker for real money from the comfort of your own home?</p>
            <p>When you embrace this option, you have something fun and exciting to do. You can play video poker at your convenience, and you don’t have to expose yourself to an uncertain physical environment.</p>
            <p></p>

                <Cornerimage src={'/image/realmoney/Online-Video-Poker-Games.png'}/>
                <p>Video poker is one of the most popular casino games, and in many cases, it generates more interest than traditional slots.</p>
                <p>Since poker is a game that everyone is familiar with, you know the general rules before you start playing. This is part of the appeal.

</p>
                <p>There’s also some decision-making involved, and this is not the case with many slot games. Since you’re presented with options, you are more intellectually involved, and this makes the game more interesting.</p>
                <p>You definitely have a head start if you understand how to play poker. However, there are rules that are specific to video poker. They vary depending on the theme of the game that you choose to play.</p>
                <p>We’re going to provide an overview for you now. We’ll stick to some generalities about a handful of commonly played games at video poker online casinos.</p>
                <p>We have also developed a comprehensive guide to all types of video poker games. You should check it out to build on your knowledge after you have digested the basics.</p>
            </div>

            <Title title={'Bonus Poker'}/>
            <p>Bonus Poker is a core form of video poker that has been a casino staple for decades. All forms of real money online video poker are based on Five-Card Draw. You are initially dealt five cards, and then you get to keep any or all of your cards, or you can choose to discard all of them.</p>
            <p>Once you select the cards you will be keeping, you press “draw” and you get fresh cards to add to the ones you kept.</p>

            <Borderedbox>
                <p>The most basic thing to understand is the fact that you get your money back if you have a pair of jacks or better. You actually win money if you get a hand that is higher than jacks or better.</p>
            </Borderedbox>
            <p>One major distinction about the game of Bonus Poker is the fact that you get double your money back for two pair. This is a decided edge that can help you prolong the viability of your bankroll.</p>
            <p> The exact payouts for each respective type of hand that you can get in a particular variation of video poker will vary depending on the policies of the site that you are playing on. Generally speaking, a full house for Bonus Poker will pay a bit more than full houses in other forms of real money video poker.</p>

            <Title title={'Double Double Bonus Poker'}/>
            <p>There are similarities between Double Double Bonus Poker and Bonus Poker, but there are couple of key differences.</p>
            <p>First, you don’t double your money if you get two pair. You also wouldn’t lose anything because you would get your bet back, but that’s the extent of it.</p>
            <p>Payouts for four of a kinds are based on the card, and there are significant premiums for some types of four of a kind hands. For example, if you get four aces playing Bonus Poker for real money, you would typically receive a $100 payout if you are playing for $1.25 a hand.</p>
            <p>With Double Double Bonus Poker, it is $200. And if you have four aces with a two, three, or four kicker, you get $500. The payouts for four of a kind hands with twos, threes, or fours also pay at a premium, and there is an extra bonus if you have one of the bonus kickers.

</p>

            <Title title={'Deuces Wild Video Poker'}/>
            <p>The Deuces Wild option is typically available at any real money video poker casino in the US. Obviously, it’s much easier to get strong hands when you have the possibility of holding a deuce or multiple deuces.</p>

            <Borderedbox>
                <p>The payouts for this game are usually lower than they would be on the other forms of video poker.</p>
            </Borderedbox>
            <p>Deuces Wild Video poker is a game where you’re mostly likely to get small wins, but get them often. There are a couple of exceptions, though.

</p>
            <p>If you get four deuces, you get a premium payout, and a natural royal flush without any deuces would pay the full standard jackpot amount.</p>
            <p>These are a just a few of the most common video poker games you can play for real money. However, there are many others, such as Jacks or Better, Aces & Faces, Joker Poker, and Split Card Poker.</p>

            <Title title={'Video Poker Tips for Winning Money'}/>
            <p>While casinos still retain a small edge, it is possible to win real money playing online video poker, especially in the short run. And especially if you use these video poker tips.

</p>

            <div>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Set aside a specific amount of money you will use as your bankroll.'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Bet in 1%-5% increments (relative to your bankroll).'}/>
                <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Never increase your bets unless you add money to that session’s bankroll.'}/>
            </div>
            <p>The idea is to stay alive long enough to let the odds play out. With proper video poker strategy and game selection, you can reduce the house edge to nearly nothing – and win real money as a result.</p>
            <p>But bankroll management isn’t enough to beat online video poker for a profit.</p>

            <Borderedbox>
                <p>A key aspect of video poker strategy is knowing which cards to keep and which cards to throw away.</p>
            </Borderedbox>
            <p>The strategy behind the cards you should keep before you draw will depend on the specific nature of the game.</p>
            <p>If you know how to play regular poker, most of the decision-making will be intuitive. At the same time, you have to understand the rules of the video poker game that you’re playing.</p>
            <p>For example, when you’re dealt a winning video poker hand, you should never muck it to aim for something higher. The one exception is when you draw four cards to the royal flush. Since the royal flush payout is so significant, over the long haul, the risk is worth it. The odds are in your favor.

</p>
            <p>And that’s not all. There’s something else to be aware of if you’re a new player.</p>
            <p>As we stated, some four of a kind hands pay premiums when there’s a certain card as the kicker. If you’re dealt a four of a kind, and the fifth card is not the kicker, you should discard it and draw another card to go with the four of a kind.</p>
            <p>Try that tip, and the other bits of video poker strategy, and you’ll tip the house edge further and further in your favor. The more you can do that, the more money you’ll win.

            <Title title={'Real Money Video Poker FAQ'}/>

            <Questionicon>What is the legal age for playing online video poker?</Questionicon>
            <p>Gambling laws vary a bit, and it often depends on the form of gaming.</p>
            <p>Most of the time, the legal gambling age is 21 years old, although some states and countries allow their people to engage in certain types of gaming when they are as young as 18.</p>

            <Questionicon>How much can you bet on video poker?</Questionicon>
            <p>Though there are some exceptions, the standard bet is between one and five coins for real money video poker.</p>
            <p>Quarters and dollars are the most commonly played coins at traditional casinos, but there are those that will accept nickels, too.</p>

            <Questionicon>What is the most you can win on one VP hand?</Questionicon>
            <p>In regular poker and real money video poker, the royal flush is the top hand. The amount you can win depends on the amount that you bet, and there’s a premium for a royal flush with five coins bet.</p>
            <p>Each casino has its own rules, but for the most part, a royal flush pays 250 to 1 if you have less than five coins bet, and 800 to 1 if you play the maximum five coins. This difference is one of the major reasons why you should play the maximum bet every hand, even if it means reducing the denomination.</p>
