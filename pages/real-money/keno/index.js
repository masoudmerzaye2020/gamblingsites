            <TextTitle title={'Now Win Money Playing Keno Online'}/>

            <p>We won’t tell you that we have a bullet-proof strategy for keno that guarantees success. If anyone does that, they’re lying. Or cheating.</p>
            <p>The truth is that keno comes with a relatively high house edge, so your long-term expectations are negative.</p>
            <p>That doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do to improve your chances when you play keno, though. We have several tips that could help your cash last longer and enhance the opportunity to get lucky and hit big playing online keno for real money.</p>
            <p>Let’s take a look at them.</p>
            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Stick to trusted keno gambling sites'}/>
            <p className='mr-4'>Some real money casinos on the web promise the world only to steal your money. Make sure to avoid them and stick to legit keno websites.</p>

            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Learn the payout table'}/>
            <p className='mr-4'>The payout table in keno determines your returns and the house edge varies greatly. For example, going for 1 number in classic keno has an expected return of 75% of the money placed while going for 10 brings back 98.82%.</p>

            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Exploit bonuses and promotions'}/>
            <p className='mr-4'>One of the positive sides of keno’s high house edge is that most online casinos can afford to offer huge real money promotions. If you take full advantage of them, your odds to win at keno increase dramatically.</p>

            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Follow the general gambling rules'}/>
            <p className='mr-4'>There are several common sense rules that apply to every single gambling game, including keno. Don’t bet real money when you’re not at your best emotional state and follow proper bankroll management. No ifs or buts!</p>
            <p>As you can see, we can’t offer some groundbreaking keno strategies to help you beat the casinos. However, following our advice will make a huge difference in the long term, so don’t underestimate the tips here just because they are relatively simple.</p>

                <p>The core of keno is always the same: you pick some numbers and wait for them to come up, so you can win some cash.</p>
                <p>And yet, the best real money keno casinos online offer different variants of the game in order to provide a more fulfilling experience to their customers.</p>
                <p>Let’s take at the most popular keno versions, so you’ll know what to expect when you face the casinos.</p>
                <p>Please note that this by no means an exhaustive list. Some of the top keno sites regularly bring out new keno games with unique twists, so we’ll stick to the best-known variants here.</p>
            </div>
            <TextTitle title={'Classic Keno'}/>
            <p>Let’s begin with the classic version that’s the most popular way to play keno for real money and is available in most casinos, online and land-based. It includes 80 numbers and each player can select between one and twenty of them at the start of the game.</p>
            <p>The next step is to draw 15 numbers and based on the number of hits, the player could win a real money prize. The rewards in keno are progressive based on how many numbers were guessed correctly. For example, if you pick the maximum 15 numbers and hit them all, you will be pretty rich it.</p>
            <p>You don’t have to hit all of the selected numbers to win if you have picked at least three. If some of them are drawn, you can still make a profit. For example, if you select three numbers in classic keno, there are three ways to win.</p>
            <p>Hitting one of them would bring your stake back, while getting two will double it. If all three numbers are drawn, you win 16 times your initial wager. There might be some slight variations in the payout table at different keno casino sites, but the overall principle is always the same in all versions.</p>
            <p>Here is a classic paytable that you can find in many online casinos with real money keno.</p>

            {/* leave image */}

            <TextTitle title={'Other Keno Variations'}/>
            <p>Many casinos both online and offline have developed their own versions of real money keno that come with some twists and turns.

            <p>Let’s explore some of the best keno games and features that we’ve found at casinos.</p>

            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Zero-Spot Bonus'}/>

            <Mainbullet link={''} desc={'Instant Keno Multiplier'}/>
            <p className='mr-4'>This keno variant features some free spaces that could multiply your reward after being hit. Once again, that works in the player’s favor and the game has a better return than classic keno. It’s not very popular, but some online casinos offer it.</p>

            <Title title={'Other Gambling Games Like Keno'}/>
            <p>If you love playing online keno for real money, we’re pretty sure that there are at least several other games offered by trusted internet casinos that will be interesting to you. They are mostly games of chances just like keno and there’s no strategy involved. However, the fun, the emotions and the opportunity to win big make up for that.</p>
            <p>On top of that, you don’t have to play them instead of keno. You can combine different options to find variety, as most online casinos offer many of these games at the same time.</p>
            
            <TextTitle title={'Bingo'}/>

                {/* imafe here */}
                <p>It’s hardly a shocker that real money bingo is our first choice when it comes to similar games offered by online casinos. It’s another game that features numbers and draws. The main difference to keno is that the cards in bingo usually come with pre-selected numbers and you compete against other players.</p>
                <p>That has its advantages, as bingo is a more social game compared to keno. Half of the fun is to talk to other players, tease them, and just enjoy their company which is impossible when you play keno, at least in most versions.</p>
                <p>On the negative side, the game often can’t compare with the biggest prizes in keno and it’s not available in as many online casinos.</p>
                <p>If you want to know more about real money bingo, check out our guide below.</p>

            <div>
                {/* imafe here */}
                <p>One of the oldest gambling games that have survived to this day is the classic lottery. It’s very similar to keno and the overall concept is the same. The problem is that you sometimes have to wait for a while to get the results, unlike keno which is instant.</p>
                <p>On the bright side, the prizes can often be VERY large, so your life could change in a heartbeat.</p>
                <p>Many online casinos have their own lottery games that run around the clock, so you can reduce the waiting period significantly and it becomes closer to instant keno. If that sounds interesting, check out our page on real money lotteries.</p>

                <p>You don’t have to wait for a single minute with our next suggestion. Scratch cards are not everyone’s cup of tea, but they certainly can be fun, especially since you could win some insane prizes at the spot. Simply buy one, scratch it and see what comes up.</p>
                <p>It’s a simple and entertaining game that is offered by many of the top real money online keno casinos. If you are interested in scratch-offs, take a look at the following page.</p>
