          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important to also claim your bonus from your initial deposit,
            which leads us to the next point.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Claim Your Bonus"} />
          <p>
            We already mentioned that the leading real money baccarat online
            casinos offer huge incentives to pick them. The biggest one is
            usually the welcome bonus for new players. It can double or
            sometimes even triple the value of your bankroll.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don’t forget to check the terms and conditions before you go for it.
            It’s important to understand what’s expected to clear the baccarat
            bonus, so you are prepared to take full advantage of the offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you’re ready and you have real cash in your account, the only
            thing left is to hit the baccarat tables.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Hit the Tables"} />
          <p>
            You usually can find baccarat tables that are suitable for all kinds
            of players. Whether you’re a casual customer who wants to have some
            fun without risking much or a high roller, you’ll spot a real money
            baccarat table that fits your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Baccarat is a simple game to play, so even if you’re new to the game
            you can get started right away.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, you’ll choose how much you want to wager. Next, you’ll place
            your bets.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’re betting on whether the Player or Banker will have the best
            hand, or if you think their hands will tie. You can bet on any one
            or combination of these options.
          </p>
          {/* leave the table */}
          <p>
            Once you’ve made your bets, hit the deal button. The computer will
            deal two hands, one for the Player and another for the Banker.
            Everything from this point on is automatic – you don’t have to do
            anything.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Withdrawing your Winnings"} />
          <p>
            If you have Lady Luck on your side, you will reach a point in which
            you have made some cash playing baccarat online. The next step would
            be to request a payout and enjoy your profits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The top online casinos with real money baccarat usually let you
            withdraw with the same payment option you used to deposit. If that’s
            not possible, you will be offered alternatives. Our advice is to
            check the different options, so you know what to expect when the
            time comes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, it must be mentioned that legit baccarat sites will ask you to
            send some documents the first time you request a payout. That’s
            because they need to confirm your identity as part of their
            anti-fraud measures and also to prevent minors from gambling with
            real money.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Play Online Baccarat on Mobile"} />
          <p>
            One of our favorite features of the top baccarat gambling sites is
            that you can play on the go. There are plenty of baccarat tables
            that are available on the likes of iPhone, iPad, Android, and
            Windows Phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have to either download the native app of the casinos or open
            their responsive websites from the browser of your device. Either
            way, the whole experience is seamless and allows you to play
            baccarat at any given moment.

            <p>
              Now that you’re ready to play baccarat online for real money,
              let’s take a look at some of the most popular variants of the
              game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the top-ranked baccarat casinos offer at least a few
              different baccarat variants, and some offer all of the ones
              detailed below. The game is fundamentally the same regardless of
              which variation you play, but there are some notable differences
              that you should be aware of.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are the most common real money baccarat games found online.
            </p>
          </div>

          <TextTitle title={"Punto Banco"} />
          <p>
            Punto Banco is one of the most popular versions of baccarat across
            the globe. Al most all real money baccarat casinos online carry this
            one.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this version, the move of the player is forced by the cards that
            are dealt. This means that there is no choice of what to do next.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Baccarat Banque"} />
          <p>
            Another variant that you can find in many online real money baccarat
            casinos is called baccarat banque. The core of the game is similar
            to punto banco, but the players have a choice this time around and
            they can decide if they should draw another card or stand.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of players prefer this variation of baccarat because they feel
            they have more control over the outcome. In reality, the house edge
            is similar and there’s not much of a difference.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Mini Baccarat"} />
          <p>
            Mini baccarat is a preferred pick for many players and casinos
            online alike because of the fast pace. As the name suggests, mini
            baccarat is played with fewer people and the goal is to save time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stakes are often lower too, so if you are looking for a dynamic
            baccarat variant, you might want to consider the mini baccarat
            tables that most of the top casinos online offer.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"More Baccarat Variants"} />
          <p>
            We’ve only covered three of the most popular versions of baccarat
            that can be found at the leading online casinos. You can play
            baccarat for real money online in many other ways. If you are
            interested to find out more about them, we can help.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a post that’s dedicated to the different versions of
            baccarat and how the rules vary. It will give you a good idea of
            what to expect in terms of the house edge that the casinos have for
            each variant.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Live Dealer Online Baccarat"} />
          <p>
            The virtual versions of real money online baccarat don’t attract as
            much attention as other evergreen classics in the casinos like
            blackjack or roulette. That’s not the case when you look at the
            tables with live dealers.
          </p>

          <Squareimage
            src={"/image/realmoney/Real-Money-Baccarat-Live-Dealer.jpg"}
          />
          <p>
            The latest streaming technologies allow online casino sites to offer
            high-quality live videos from special studios or land-based casinos
            in real time. That delivers the best of both worlds, as you get to
            enjoy real cards, chips, and interaction with a friendly croupier.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, you still play with all the benefits that come
            with playing real money baccarat online. The user interface is
            simple and efficient, the pace is fast, and on top of everything
            else, most casinos have special bonuses for live dealers.
          </p>

          <Title title={"Win Real Money at Online Baccarat Casinos"} />
          <p>
            No one plays online baccarat for real money to deliberately lose,
            but the harsh reality is that’s the most likely outcome in the long
            run. Even the best versions of the game come with an advantage for
            the casinos that can be overcome only by luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, there are several ways to improve your chances of winning
            at baccarat. Let’s see how.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Learn the Rules and Apply Optimal Strategy"} />
          <p>
            The different versions of real money baccarat online come with
            different rules. Each of them features a variable house edge that
            depends on your wagers. In some versions, you have to go for the
            player’s hand while backing the dealer is better in others.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best example is the classic punto banco version offered in
            almost all online casinos with real money baccarat. You should
            always bet on the house there, as the house edge is slightly lower.
          </p>
          <Borderedbox>
            <p>
              What you should avoid at all costs is betting on the tie. While
              the potential return might seem tempting, the gambling sites have
              an enormous advantage of over 14% on that outcome.
            </p>
          </Borderedbox>
          <p>
            Our main point is that you should always carefully check the rules
            and the payouts before placing real money wagers. That will help you
            pick the smart bets and improve your odds.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Stick to Trusted Casinos"} />
          <p>
            You might be tempted to try real money baccarat games that promise
            excellent returns and casinos that offer insane promotions that no
            one else does. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn’t.
            These are the tools used by shady online casinos to attract new
            customers with the intention of stealing their cash.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why you should always go for legit real money gambling sites
            with a proper license and a strong reputation in the industry and
            with players. All of our recommended baccarat casinos meet that
            criteria.
          </p>

          <TextTitle title={"Exploit Bonuses and Promotions"} />
          <p>
            We already talked about the bonuses of the best real money baccarat
            sites, so we won’t spend too much time on this one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s just say that you should always explore your options and try
            to get any extra value you can.
